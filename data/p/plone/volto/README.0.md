Jupyter Robot Framework notebook
================================

Jupyter notebook with Robot Framework kernel makes it easy to learn, sketch and debug Robot Framework tests directly from browser, from a Jupyter notebook.

This should be convenient way to write and debug Robot Framework tests with
quick feedback on test issues.
