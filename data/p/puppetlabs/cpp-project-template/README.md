# CppProjectTemplate

CppProjectTemplate is a C++ project template for use in creating new command-line utility projects using PuppetLabs' shared libraries.

## Required packages

You will need to install [Boost](http://boost.org) for program_options and to use many of the libraries in [Leatherman](https://github.com/puppetlabs/leatherman).

## Creating a new project

This is most simply accomplished with [Hub](https://hub.github.com/). The following commands will create a new GitHub project based on this template named `new-project` under the `puppetlabs` organization. Use Hub's `-p` option to create a private repo.

```
hub clone --depth 1 --origin source puppetlabs/cpp-project-template new-project
cd new-project
hub create puppetlabs/new-project [-p]
git commit --amend # Rewrite the commit message, and erase the fact that it's a shallow copy
git push origin new-project
```

Finally update the project() name in CMakeLists.txt.

## Build the library

This template is a fully functional example, and can be built with

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j
```

CMake will generate source files from template files based on the project declared in CMakeLists.txt. For cpp-project-template, git ignores the generated files. For your own project, you can check those files in, and eventually remove the template files and generation logic from CMake as you develop your project (look for the REMOVE string in CMakeLists.txt files).

Tests can be run with `make test`, and the example tool can be run with `bin/cpp_project_template`.
