### Docker Benefits

 - Fast (deployment, migration, restarts)
 - Secure
 - Lightweight (save disk & CPU)
 - Open Source
 - Portable software
 - Microservices and integrations (APIs)
 - Simplify DevOps
 - Version control capabilities

---

### Common Docker usages

 - Sandbox environment (develop, test, debug, educate)
 - Continuous Integration & Deployment
 - Scaling apps
 - Development collaboration
 - Infrastructure configuration
 - Local development
 - Multi-tier applications
 - PaaS, SaaS

---

### Technology behind Docker

 - Linux [x86-64](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/X86-64)
 - [Go](https://golang.org/) language
 - [Client - Server](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Client%E2%80%93server_model) (deamon) architecture
 - Union file systems ([UnionFS](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/UnionFS): AUFS, btrfs, vfs etc)
 - [Namespaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups#NAMESPACE-ISOLATION) (pid, net, ipc, mnt, uts)
 - Control Groups ([cgroups](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cgroups))
 - Container format ([libcontainer](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/tree/master/libcontainer "Libcontainer provides a native Go implementation for creating containers with namespaces, cgroups, capabilities, and filesystem access controls. It allows you to manage the lifecycle of the container performing additional operations after the container is created."))

### Docker Component Architecture

![Docker component architecture](https://docs.docker.com/engine/images/engine-components-flow.png)



---

### Docker client

It is the primary user interface to Docker. It accepts commands from the user
and communicates back and forth with a Docker daemon.

---

### Docker daemon

It runs on a host machine. The user does not directly interact with the daemon,
but instead through the Docker client with the RESTful api or sockets.

---

### Docker engine

A Client with a Daemon as also as the docker-compose tool. Usually referred simply as "docker".

---

### Docker machine

![Docker machine logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theodorosploumis/docker-presentation/gh-pages/img/docker_machine.png)

A tool which makes it really easy to create Docker hosts on your computer,
on cloud providers and inside your own data center.
It creates servers, installs Docker on them, then configures the Docker client to talk to them.
Required for Mac, Windows users.

---

### Docker compose

![Docker compose logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theodorosploumis/docker-presentation/gh-pages/img/docker_compose.png)

A tool for defining and running complex applications with Docker
(eg a multi-container application) with a single file.

---

### Docker swarm

![Docker swarm logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theodorosploumis/docker-presentation/gh-pages/img/docker_swarm.png)

A native clustering tool for Docker. Swarm pools together several Docker
hosts and exposes them as a single virtual Docker host. It scale up to multiple hosts.

---

### Docker distribution

![Docker distribution logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theodorosploumis/docker-presentation/gh-pages/img/docker_distribution.png)

A (hosted) service containing repositories of images which responds to the Registry API.

---

### The docker image

![ubuntu:15.04 image](https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/images/container-layers.jpg) 

- Each Docker image references a list of read-only layers that represent filesystem differences.
- Layers are stacked on top of each other to form a base for a containerâ€™s root filesystem.

---

### The docker container

![container using ubuntu:15.04 image](https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/images/sharing-layers.jpg) 

- A runnable instance of the image, basically it is a process isolated by docker that runs on top of the filesystem that an image provides. 
- For each containers there is a new, thin, writable layer - container layer - on top of the underlying stack (image).

### Docker tips and best practices

Here are some basic tips and best practices for writing Dockerfiles,
building docker Images and using Docker in general. Feel free to add your suggestions
with a pull request.

- Create Dockerfiles with cache (of the layers) in mind.
- Use empty lines, comments and backslashes ("\") for readability.
- Keep each image layer "atomic".
- Optimize containers (check [fromlatest.io](https://www.fromlatest.io/) and [imagelayers.io](https://imagelayers.io)).
- Containers are not Virtual Machines.
- Think of creating your own private registry.
- Use docker-compose.yml templates if you need permanent containers.
- Be aware of the hub.docker.com agent version (different versions need different Dockerfile).
- Group common operations under the same instruction.
- Don't install useless software.
- Keep images small and unique.
- Search for similar public images before creating your own.
- When you need software to install another software remove the first after the build.
- Uppercase the Dockerfile instructions.
- Split the Dockerfile instructions while developing your Dockerfile and merge them when you are ready to publish it.
- Split multiprocess images to several images with one process per images.
- Use ADD and VOLUME at the end of the Dockerfile (except if files are needed before).
- If you have multiple Dockerfile steps that use different files from your context, ```COPY``` them individually, rather than all at once.
- Prefer using an ENTRYPOINT always.
- Install specific versions of software.
- With COPY the directories are not copied, only their files.
- When using a base image choose a specific tag (avoid default tag "latest").
- Never map directly the public port inside a Dockerfile.
- Prefer using the array syntax for CMD, ENTRYPOINT etc (```CMD [...]```).
- Prefer the tiny base images (busybox, alpine, tinycore, baseimage etc).
- Build your own base image when you want full control of the Dockerfile.
- Things that do not change ofter should stay on top of the Dockerfile (eg MAINTAINER).
- If you need to work with local files use VOLUME and not ADD.
- Test builds locally before triggering automated builds on online docker registries.
- Use ```Dockerfile``` for infrastructure and ```docker-compose``` for tasks.
- Regex used in Dockerfiles are from Go language.
- Never do things like ```apt-get upgrade``` inside a Dockerfile.
- Containers should model processes and not virtual machines.
- Create local shortcut/aliases for common docker commands and workflows.
- Be careful with volumes. When docker mounts folders on read-write mode your files may be deleted.
- A volume will never be deleted as long as a container is linked to it.
- Use shell scripts for complicated RUN commands on the Dockerfile as also as for starting processes on containers.
- Running the same image multiple times does not add multiple images on the host disk (```1x ubuntu:latest == 100x ubuntu:latest```).
- Avoid using a GUI. CLI makes it easier to understand the Docker philosophy.
- Prefer running processes inside containers with a non ROOT user for security reasons.

## Dependencies

Themes are written using Sass to keep things modular and reduce the need for repeated selectors across files. Make sure that you have the reveal.js development environment including the Grunt dependencies installed before proceding: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#full-setup

You also need to install Ruby and then Sass (with `gem install sass`).

## Creating a Theme

To create your own theme, start by duplicating any ```.scss``` file in [/css/theme/source](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/css/theme/source) and adding it to the compilation list in the [Gruntfile](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/Gruntfile.js).

Each theme file does four things in the following order:

1. **Include [/css/theme/template/mixins.scss](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/css/theme/template/mixins.scss)**
Shared utility functions.

2. **Include [/css/theme/template/settings.scss](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/css/theme/template/settings.scss)**
Declares a set of custom variables that the template file (step 4) expects. Can be overridden in step 3.

3. **Override**
This is where you override the default theme. Either by specifying variables (see [settings.scss](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/css/theme/template/settings.scss) for reference) or by adding full selectors with hardcoded styles.

4. **Include [/css/theme/template/theme.scss](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/css/theme/template/theme.scss)**
The template theme file which will generate final CSS output based on the currently defined variables.

When you are done, run `grunt css-themes` to compile the Sass file to CSS and you are ready to use your new theme.
