## Owlery

[Owlery](https://owlery.phenoscape.org/api/) is a set of REST web services, built on the [akka-http](https://akka.io) toolkit, which allow querying of an OWL reasoner containing a configured set of ontologies, via HTTP.

It also provides a web service front-end for [Owlet](https://github.com/phenoscape/owlet), which can be used as a remote SERVICE in a [SPARQL federated query](http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-federated-query/).
