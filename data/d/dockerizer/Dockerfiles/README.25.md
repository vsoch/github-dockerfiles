    # Firefox on Docker

    this has been done all over the net <br>
    just another dockerfile for firefox browser <br>
    <br>
    I wanted to have browser with 1GB limit, <br>
    after this browser mining shit rises <br>
    <br>
    so brace yourself miners, my Firefox handles up to 1GB memory.
