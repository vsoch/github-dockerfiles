drone-plugin-go
===============

This is a package with simple support for writing Drone plugins in Go.

## Overview

Plugins are executable files run by Drone to customize the build lifecycle. Plugins receive input data from `stdin` (or `arg[1]`) and write the results to `stdout`

```sh
./slack-plugin <<EOF
{
    "repo" : {
        "owner": "foo",
        "name": "bar",
        "full_name": "foo/bar"
    },
    "build" : {
        "number": 1
        "status": "success",
        "started_at": 1421029603,
        "finished_at": 1421029813,
        "head_commit" : {
            "sha": "9f2849d5",
            "ref": "refs/heads/master"
            "branch": "master",
            "message": "Update the Readme",
            "author": {
                "login": "johnsmith"
                "email": "john.smith@gmail.com",
            }
        }
    },
    "job" : {
        "number": 1,
        "status": "success",
        "started_at": 1421029603,
        "finished_at": 1421029813,
        "exit_code": 0,
        "environment": { "GO_VERSION": "1.4" }
    }
    "clone" : {
        "branch": "master",
        "remote": "git://github.com/drone/drone",
        "dir": "/drone/src/github.com/drone/drone",
        "ref": "refs/heads/master",
        "sha": "436b7a6e2abaddfd35740527353e78a227ddcb2c"
    },
    "vargs": {
        "webhook_url": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/...",
        "username": "drone",
        "channel": "#dev"
    }
}
EOF
```

Use this `plugin` package to retrieve and parse input parameters:

```Go
var repo = plugin.Repo{}
var build = plugin.Build{}
var slack = struct {
    URL      string `json:"webhook_url"`
    Username string `json:"username"`
    Channel  string `json:"channel"`
}{}

plugin.Param("repo", &repo)
plugin.Param("build", &build)
plugin.Param("vargs", &slack)
plugin.Parse()
```

Note that your plugin configuration data (declared in the `.drone.yml` file) will be provided in the `vargs` section of the JSON input.

### Shared Volumes

The repository clone directory (specified in the `clone.dir` input parameter) will be shared across all plugins as a [container volume](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockervolumes/#creating-and-mounting-a-data-volume-container). This means that any files in your repository directory or subdirectories are accessible to plugins. This is useful for plugins that analyze or archive files, such as an S3 plugin.

### Publishing

Drone plugins are distributed as Docker images. We therefore recommend publishing your plugins to [Docker Hub](https://index.docker.io).

The `ENTRYPOINT` must be defined and must point to your executable file. The `CMD` section will be overridden by Drone and will be used to send the JSON encoded data in `arg[1]`. An example Dockerfile for your plugin might look like this:

```Dockerfile
# Docker image for Drone's git-clone plugin
#
#     docker build -t drone/drone-clone-git .

FROM library/golang:1.4

# copy the local src files to the container's workspace.
ADD . /go/src/github.com/drone/drone-clone-git/

# build the git-clone plugin inside the container.
RUN go get github.com/drone/drone-clone-git/... && \
    go install github.com/drone/drone-clone-git

# run the git-clone plugin when the container starts
ENTRYPOINT ["/go/bin/drone-clone-git"]
```
go-difflib
==========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pmezard/go-difflib.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pmezard/go-difflib)
[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/pmezard/go-difflib/difflib?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/pmezard/go-difflib/difflib)

Go-difflib is a partial port of python 3 difflib package. Its main goal
was to make unified and context diff available in pure Go, mostly for
testing purposes.

The following class and functions (and related tests) have be ported:

* `SequenceMatcher`
* `unified_diff()`
* `context_diff()`

## Installation

```bash
$ go get github.com/pmezard/go-difflib/difflib
```

### Quick Start

Diffs are configured with Unified (or ContextDiff) structures, and can
be output to an io.Writer or returned as a string.

```Go
diff := UnifiedDiff{
    A:        difflib.SplitLines("foo\nbar\n"),
    B:        difflib.SplitLines("foo\nbaz\n"),
    FromFile: "Original",
    ToFile:   "Current",
    Context:  3,
}
text, _ := GetUnifiedDiffString(diff)
fmt.Printf(text)
```

would output:

```
--- Original
+++ Current
@@ -1,3 +1,3 @@
 foo
-bar
+baz
```

Testify - Thou Shalt Write Tests
================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stretchr/testify.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/stretchr/testify) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/stretchr/testify)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/stretchr/testify) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify)

Go code (golang) set of packages that provide many tools for testifying that your code will behave as you intend.

Features include:

  * [Easy assertions](#assert-package)
  * [Mocking](#mock-package)
  * [HTTP response trapping](#http-package)
  * [Testing suite interfaces and functions](#suite-package)

Get started:

  * Install testify with [one line of code](#installation), or [update it with another](#staying-up-to-date)
  * For an introduction to writing test code in Go, see http://golang.org/doc/code.html#Testing
  * Check out the API Documentation http://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify
  * To make your testing life easier, check out our other project, [gorc](http://github.com/stretchr/gorc)
  * A little about [Test-Driven Development (TDD)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)



[`assert`](http://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/assert "API documentation") package
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `assert` package provides some helpful methods that allow you to write better test code in Go.

  * Prints friendly, easy to read failure descriptions
  * Allows for very readable code
  * Optionally annotate each assertion with a message

See it in action:

```go
package yours

import (
  "testing"
  "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
)

func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {

  // assert equality
  assert.Equal(t, 123, 123, "they should be equal")

  // assert inequality
  assert.NotEqual(t, 123, 456, "they should not be equal")

  // assert for nil (good for errors)
  assert.Nil(t, object)

  // assert for not nil (good when you expect something)
  if assert.NotNil(t, object) {

    // now we know that object isn't nil, we are safe to make
    // further assertions without causing any errors
    assert.Equal(t, "Something", object.Value)

  }

}
```

  * Every assert func takes the `testing.T` object as the first argument.  This is how it writes the errors out through the normal `go test` capabilities.
  * Every assert func returns a bool indicating whether the assertion was successful or not, this is useful for if you want to go on making further assertions under certain conditions.

if you assert many times, use the below:

```go
package yours

import (
  "testing"
  "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
)

func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {
  assert := assert.New(t)

  // assert equality
  assert.Equal(123, 123, "they should be equal")

  // assert inequality
  assert.NotEqual(123, 456, "they should not be equal")

  // assert for nil (good for errors)
  assert.Nil(object)

  // assert for not nil (good when you expect something)
  if assert.NotNil(object) {

    // now we know that object isn't nil, we are safe to make
    // further assertions without causing any errors
    assert.Equal("Something", object.Value)
  }
}
```

[`require`](http://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/require "API documentation") package
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `require` package provides same global functions as the `assert` package, but instead of returning a boolean result they terminate current test.

See [t.FailNow](http://golang.org/pkg/testing/#T.FailNow) for details.


[`http`](http://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/http "API documentation") package
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `http` package contains test objects useful for testing code that relies on the `net/http` package.  Check out the [(deprecated) API documentation for the `http` package](http://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/http).

We recommend you use [httptest](http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/httptest) instead.

[`mock`](http://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/mock "API documentation") package
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `mock` package provides a mechanism for easily writing mock objects that can be used in place of real objects when writing test code.

An example test function that tests a piece of code that relies on an external object `testObj`, can setup expectations (testify) and assert that they indeed happened:

```go
package yours

import (
  "testing"
  "github.com/stretchr/testify/mock"
)

/*
  Test objects
*/

// MyMockedObject is a mocked object that implements an interface
// that describes an object that the code I am testing relies on.
type MyMockedObject struct{
  mock.Mock
}

// DoSomething is a method on MyMockedObject that implements some interface
// and just records the activity, and returns what the Mock object tells it to.
//
// In the real object, this method would do something useful, but since this
// is a mocked object - we're just going to stub it out.
//
// NOTE: This method is not being tested here, code that uses this object is.
func (m *MyMockedObject) DoSomething(number int) (bool, error) {

  args := m.Called(number)
  return args.Bool(0), args.Error(1)

}

/*
  Actual test functions
*/

// TestSomething is an example of how to use our test object to
// make assertions about some target code we are testing.
func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {

  // create an instance of our test object
  testObj := new(MyMockedObject)

  // setup expectations
  testObj.On("DoSomething", 123).Return(true, nil)

  // call the code we are testing
  targetFuncThatDoesSomethingWithObj(testObj)

  // assert that the expectations were met
  testObj.AssertExpectations(t)

}
```

For more information on how to write mock code, check out the [API documentation for the `mock` package](http://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/mock).

You can use the [mockery tool](http://github.com/vektra/mockery) to autogenerate the mock code against an interface as well, making using mocks much quicker.

[`suite`](http://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/suite "API documentation") package
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `suite` package provides functionality that you might be used to from more common object oriented languages.  With it, you can build a testing suite as a struct, build setup/teardown methods and testing methods on your struct, and run them with 'go test' as per normal.

An example suite is shown below:

```go
// Basic imports
import (
    "testing"
    "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
    "github.com/stretchr/testify/suite"
)

// Define the suite, and absorb the built-in basic suite
// functionality from testify - including a T() method which
// returns the current testing context
type ExampleTestSuite struct {
    suite.Suite
    VariableThatShouldStartAtFive int
}

// Make sure that VariableThatShouldStartAtFive is set to five
// before each test
func (suite *ExampleTestSuite) SetupTest() {
    suite.VariableThatShouldStartAtFive = 5
}

// All methods that begin with "Test" are run as tests within a
// suite.
func (suite *ExampleTestSuite) TestExample() {
    assert.Equal(suite.T(), 5, suite.VariableThatShouldStartAtFive)
}

// In order for 'go test' to run this suite, we need to create
// a normal test function and pass our suite to suite.Run
func TestExampleTestSuite(t *testing.T) {
    suite.Run(t, new(ExampleTestSuite))
}
```

For a more complete example, using all of the functionality provided by the suite package, look at our [example testing suite](https://github.com/stretchr/testify/blob/master/suite/suite_test.go)

For more information on writing suites, check out the [API documentation for the `suite` package](http://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/suite).

`Suite` object has assertion methods:

```go
// Basic imports
import (
    "testing"
    "github.com/stretchr/testify/suite"
)

// Define the suite, and absorb the built-in basic suite
// functionality from testify - including assertion methods.
type ExampleTestSuite struct {
    suite.Suite
    VariableThatShouldStartAtFive int
}

// Make sure that VariableThatShouldStartAtFive is set to five
// before each test
func (suite *ExampleTestSuite) SetupTest() {
    suite.VariableThatShouldStartAtFive = 5
}

// All methods that begin with "Test" are run as tests within a
// suite.
func (suite *ExampleTestSuite) TestExample() {
    suite.Equal(suite.VariableThatShouldStartAtFive, 5)
}

// In order for 'go test' to run this suite, we need to create
// a normal test function and pass our suite to suite.Run
func TestExampleTestSuite(t *testing.T) {
    suite.Run(t, new(ExampleTestSuite))
}
```

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/davecgh/go-spew.png?branch=master)]
(https://travis-ci.org/davecgh/go-spew) [![Coverage Status]
(https://coveralls.io/repos/davecgh/go-spew/badge.png?branch=master)]
(https://coveralls.io/r/davecgh/go-spew?branch=master)

Go-spew implements a deep pretty printer for Go data structures to aid in
debugging.  A comprehensive suite of tests with 100% test coverage is provided
to ensure proper functionality.  See `test_coverage.txt` for the gocov coverage
report.  Go-spew is licensed under the liberal ISC license, so it may be used in
open source or commercial projects.

If you're interested in reading about how this package came to life and some
of the challenges involved in providing a deep pretty printer, there is a blog
post about it
[here](https://web.archive.org/web/20160304013555/https://blog.cyphertite.com/go-spew-a-journey-into-dumping-go-data-structures/).

## Documentation

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/davecgh/go-spew/spew?status.png)]
(http://godoc.org/github.com/davecgh/go-spew/spew)

Full `go doc` style documentation for the project can be viewed online without
installing this package by using the excellent GoDoc site here:
http://godoc.org/github.com/davecgh/go-spew/spew

You can also view the documentation locally once the package is installed with
the `godoc` tool by running `godoc -http=":6060"` and pointing your browser to
http://localhost:6060/pkg/github.com/davecgh/go-spew/spew

## Installation

```bash
$ go get -u github.com/davecgh/go-spew/spew
```

## Quick Start

Add this import line to the file you're working in:

```Go
import "github.com/davecgh/go-spew/spew"
```

To dump a variable with full newlines, indentation, type, and pointer
information use Dump, Fdump, or Sdump:

```Go
spew.Dump(myVar1, myVar2, ...)
spew.Fdump(someWriter, myVar1, myVar2, ...)
str := spew.Sdump(myVar1, myVar2, ...)
```

Alternatively, if you would prefer to use format strings with a compacted inline
printing style, use the convenience wrappers Printf, Fprintf, etc with %v (most
compact), %+v (adds pointer addresses), %#v (adds types), or %#+v (adds types
and pointer addresses): 

```Go
spew.Printf("myVar1: %v -- myVar2: %+v", myVar1, myVar2)
spew.Printf("myVar3: %#v -- myVar4: %#+v", myVar3, myVar4)
spew.Fprintf(someWriter, "myVar1: %v -- myVar2: %+v", myVar1, myVar2)
spew.Fprintf(someWriter, "myVar3: %#v -- myVar4: %#+v", myVar3, myVar4)
```

## Debugging a Web Application Example

Here is an example of how you can use `spew.Sdump()` to help debug a web application. Please be sure to wrap your output using the `html.EscapeString()` function for safety reasons. You should also only use this debugging technique in a development environment, never in production.

```Go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "html"
    "net/http"

    "github.com/davecgh/go-spew/spew"
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "text/html")
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hi there, %s!", r.URL.Path[1:])
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "<!--\n" + html.EscapeString(spew.Sdump(w)) + "\n-->")
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

## Sample Dump Output

```
(main.Foo) {
 unexportedField: (*main.Bar)(0xf84002e210)({
  flag: (main.Flag) flagTwo,
  data: (uintptr) <nil>
 }),
 ExportedField: (map[interface {}]interface {}) {
  (string) "one": (bool) true
 }
}
([]uint8) {
 00000000  11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18  19 1a 1b 1c 1d 1e 1f 20  |............... |
 00000010  21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  29 2a 2b 2c 2d 2e 2f 30  |!"#$%&'()*+,-./0|
 00000020  31 32                                             |12|
}
```

## Sample Formatter Output

Double pointer to a uint8:
```
	  %v: <**>5
	 %+v: <**>(0xf8400420d0->0xf8400420c8)5
	 %#v: (**uint8)5
	%#+v: (**uint8)(0xf8400420d0->0xf8400420c8)5
```

Pointer to circular struct with a uint8 field and a pointer to itself:
```
	  %v: <*>{1 <*><shown>}
	 %+v: <*>(0xf84003e260){ui8:1 c:<*>(0xf84003e260)<shown>}
	 %#v: (*main.circular){ui8:(uint8)1 c:(*main.circular)<shown>}
	%#+v: (*main.circular)(0xf84003e260){ui8:(uint8)1 c:(*main.circular)(0xf84003e260)<shown>}
```

## Configuration Options

Configuration of spew is handled by fields in the ConfigState type. For
convenience, all of the top-level functions use a global state available via the
spew.Config global.

It is also possible to create a ConfigState instance that provides methods
equivalent to the top-level functions. This allows concurrent configuration
options. See the ConfigState documentation for more details.

```
* Indent
	String to use for each indentation level for Dump functions.
	It is a single space by default.  A popular alternative is "\t".

* MaxDepth
	Maximum number of levels to descend into nested data structures.
	There is no limit by default.

* DisableMethods
	Disables invocation of error and Stringer interface methods.
	Method invocation is enabled by default.

* DisablePointerMethods
	Disables invocation of error and Stringer interface methods on types
	which only accept pointer receivers from non-pointer variables.  This option
	relies on access to the unsafe package, so it will not have any effect when
	running in environments without access to the unsafe package such as Google
	App Engine or with the "safe" build tag specified.
	Pointer method invocation is enabled by default.

* ContinueOnMethod
	Enables recursion into types after invoking error and Stringer interface
	methods. Recursion after method invocation is disabled by default.

* SortKeys
	Specifies map keys should be sorted before being printed. Use
	this to have a more deterministic, diffable output.  Note that
	only native types (bool, int, uint, floats, uintptr and string)
	and types which implement error or Stringer interfaces are supported,
	with other types sorted according to the reflect.Value.String() output
	which guarantees display stability.  Natural map order is used by
	default.

* SpewKeys
	SpewKeys specifies that, as a last resort attempt, map keys should be
	spewed to strings and sorted by those strings.  This is only considered
	if SortKeys is true.

```

## Unsafe Package Dependency

This package relies on the unsafe package to perform some of the more advanced
features, however it also supports a "limited" mode which allows it to work in
environments where the unsafe package is not available.  By default, it will
operate in this mode on Google App Engine and when compiled with GopherJS.  The
"safe" build tag may also be specified to force the package to build without
using the unsafe package.
