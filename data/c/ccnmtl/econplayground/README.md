# EconPlayground [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ccnmtl/econplayground.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ccnmtl/econplayground) [![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/ccnmtl/econplayground.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

EconPractice is an environment for authoring and interacting with economics concepts. Our practice modules allow instructors to set up an economics scenario with an accompanying graph. Students can then interact with that graph, moving curves and changing values. Students can receive immediate feedback for these movements, based on expertise provided by the instructor.

We've developed this tool with macroeconomics as the initial focus, with possibilities of expanding to microeconomics in the future.

EconPractice integrates with learning management systems such as Canvas, allowing for assessment to happen using our tool.

EconPractice is developed and maintained as an open source tool called EconPlayground. Our source code is released with the [GNU GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt) license. We have a separate repository for the JavaScript application [here](https://github.com/ccnmtl/econplayground.js).
