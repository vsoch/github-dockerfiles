This project contains configuration files for provisioning a full ipython notebook setup including

* numpy
* matplotlib (inline graphics enabled)
* pandas
* gensim
* nltk
* textblob

## Docker installation
For creating a server version of ipython notebook, running within a Docker container

See the ./Docker directory README for instructions.

## Vagrant installation
For creating a local version of ipython notebook, running within a vagrant virtual machine.  Once vagrant is installed on Windows/OS X/Linux, you should be able to easily bring up an ipython notebook server that you can access through your webbrowser on your local machine.

See the `./Vagrant` directory README for instructions.
