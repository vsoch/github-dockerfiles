#
# Before building this Dockerfile, BlueOcean needs to be built locally using Maven
# You can build everything needed and this Dockerfile by invoking `bin/build-in-docker.sh -m`
#

# Effective version should be kept in sync with jenkins.properties of pom.xml
# Use `docker run jenkins/jenkins:lts --version` to obtain latest LTS version
# Patch version is not to be considered, we prefer to base the image off the latest LTS of the line
# and keep the dependency on the baseline in pom.xml
