## Development Testing

For your convenience, this repository includes a docker-compose configuration
for running jenkins, rancher-server, and a rancher agent. It also includes a
bootstrapping script which will configure a Rancher service and Jenkins job
using the plugin from `build/libs/rancher.hpi`. To use this test harness simply
run the following:

```
./gradlew jpi
cd test/
docker-compose up -d --build
```

Rancher, Jenkins, and an Echo Server will be run on ports 8080, 8081, and 8082
respectively. You can simply visit the jenkins web UI and run the "test" job to
test the plugin.
