# Zenkit Î¼svc Template

Given Docker and a Go development environment, this repository can create you
a ready-to-go microservice scaffold using its companion library,
[zenkit](https://github.com/zenoss/zenkit).

## Required environment
* You should have Go and Docker set up and usable by your current user.
* You should be in the directory under `$GOPATH` representing the owner of the
  repository you're creating (e.g., `$GOPATH/src/github.com/zenoss`).

## Quickstart
Just run this to create a microservice named `examplesvc`:

    bash <(curl -sSL https://git.io/vQB98) examplesvc

(That shortlink is just [create.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zenoss/zenkit-template/master/create.sh) from this very repo.)

This will ask you a series of questions. You can always change the answers
later, except the first one, which is prefilled for you.

Once it's generated, go into your new directory and run `make` to pull in
dependencies and get everything set up:

    cd examplesvc
    make

Now you can start the thing, if you want. It doesn't do much, but it will
run:

    make run

And you can make requests:

    http :8080/hello/dolly
    http :8080/hello/newman
    
## Contributing
You, too, can contribute to zenkit-template!

It's as easy as 1-2-3!

1. Make a branch with your changes

       git checkout -b improvements

2. Run the create-local.sh script to test your changes (from the parent
   directory)

       zenkit-template/create-local.sh my-test-service

3. Test your newly deployed microservice, and if it looks good, open a pull request!
