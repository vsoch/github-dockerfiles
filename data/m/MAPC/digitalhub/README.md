## CMS Instructions

### Home Page

To add content on the home page below the interruption bar
("below the fold"), an editor must add a new page part called "Bottom", with the
slug "bottom".

### Process Timeline

To add phases to the process timeline you must create a new page part with the word "Phase" in it. The phases will be ordered in the order that these page parts are added to the page. The page must also use the "Process Timeline" view template.
