## Installation

We currently recommend the use of
[Docker to set up the Marketplace backend](http://marketplace.readthedocs.org/en/latest/topics/backend.html). You can also look at our [old documentation](http://zamboni.readthedocs.org) for manual installation, but it is not recommended.

We'd love your help! You can come talk to us on
[irc://irc.mozilla.org/marketplace](irc://irc.mozilla.org/marketplace) if you
have questions.
