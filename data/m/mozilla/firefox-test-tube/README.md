Firefox Test Tube displays the results of multivariate experiments that are
being conducted within Firefox.

While the platform is open source, the data unfortunately cannot be. To run Test
Tube outside of Mozilla, be sure to disable authentication or obtain your own
private keys.

Test Tube is the successor to [Experiments
Viewer](https://github.com/mozilla/experiments-viewer). Whereas Experiments
Viewer was forked from an existing project for the sake of expediency, Test Tube
was written from the ground up to address relevant user needs with clean and
maintainable code.
