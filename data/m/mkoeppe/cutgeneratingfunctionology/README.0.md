This directory contains individual Sage files that set up some
example functions.  We preserve them here only for our own reference. 

To find interesting examples with explanation, we recommend to check
extreme_functions_in_literature.sage and survey_examples.sage instead.

Note:

- The files thebe_status_field.js and .css are taken verbatim from the
  examples directory of the thebelab sources, with with one change;
  see commit bf3dd0c.
In the interest of full transparency, this directory contains the Sage
code for making the graphics in the survey and several papers.

It shows some ways to customize the output but is otherwise not very
interesting.

It also serves as a graphics test suite, which can be invoked by typing
"make check-graphics" at the top level.
