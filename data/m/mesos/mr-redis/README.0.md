# Codec

High Performance, Feature-Rich Idiomatic Go codec/encoding library for
binc, msgpack, cbor, json.

Supported Serialization formats are:

  - msgpack: https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack
  - binc:    http://github.com/ugorji/binc
  - cbor:    http://cbor.io http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049
  - json:    http://json.org http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159
  - simple: 

To install:

    go get github.com/ugorji/go/codec

This package understands the `unsafe` tag, to allow using unsafe semantics:

  - When decoding into a struct, you need to read the field name as a string 
    so you can find the struct field it is mapped to.
    Using `unsafe` will bypass the allocation and copying overhead of `[]byte->string` conversion.

To use it, you must pass the `unsafe` tag during install:

```
go install -tags=unsafe github.com/ugorji/go/codec 
```

Online documentation: http://godoc.org/github.com/ugorji/go/codec  
Detailed Usage/How-to Primer: http://ugorji.net/blog/go-codec-primer

The idiomatic Go support is as seen in other encoding packages in
the standard library (ie json, xml, gob, etc).

Rich Feature Set includes:

  - Simple but extremely powerful and feature-rich API
  - Very High Performance.
    Our extensive benchmarks show us outperforming Gob, Json, Bson, etc by 2-4X.
  - Multiple conversions:
    Package coerces types where appropriate 
    e.g. decode an int in the stream into a float, etc.
  - Corner Cases: 
    Overflows, nil maps/slices, nil values in streams are handled correctly
  - Standard field renaming via tags
  - Support for omitting empty fields during an encoding
  - Encoding from any value and decoding into pointer to any value
    (struct, slice, map, primitives, pointers, interface{}, etc)
  - Extensions to support efficient encoding/decoding of any named types
  - Support encoding.(Binary|Text)(M|Unm)arshaler interfaces
  - Decoding without a schema (into a interface{}).
    Includes Options to configure what specific map or slice type to use
    when decoding an encoded list or map into a nil interface{}
  - Encode a struct as an array, and decode struct from an array in the data stream
  - Comprehensive support for anonymous fields
  - Fast (no-reflection) encoding/decoding of common maps and slices
  - Code-generation for faster performance.
  - Support binary (e.g. messagepack, cbor) and text (e.g. json) formats
  - Support indefinite-length formats to enable true streaming 
    (for formats which support it e.g. json, cbor)
  - Support canonical encoding, where a value is ALWAYS encoded as same sequence of bytes.
    This mostly applies to maps, where iteration order is non-deterministic.
  - NIL in data stream decoded as zero value
  - Never silently skip data when decoding.
    User decides whether to return an error or silently skip data when keys or indexes
    in the data stream do not map to fields in the struct.
  - Encode/Decode from/to chan types (for iterative streaming support)
  - Drop-in replacement for encoding/json. `json:` key in struct tag supported.
  - Provides a RPC Server and Client Codec for net/rpc communication protocol.
  - Handle unique idiosynchracies of codecs e.g. 
    - For messagepack, configure how ambiguities in handling raw bytes are resolved 
    - For messagepack, provide rpc server/client codec to support
      msgpack-rpc protocol defined at:
      https://github.com/msgpack-rpc/msgpack-rpc/blob/master/spec.md

## Extension Support

Users can register a function to handle the encoding or decoding of
their custom types.

There are no restrictions on what the custom type can be. Some examples:

    type BisSet   []int
    type BitSet64 uint64
    type UUID     string
    type MyStructWithUnexportedFields struct { a int; b bool; c []int; }
    type GifImage struct { ... }

As an illustration, MyStructWithUnexportedFields would normally be
encoded as an empty map because it has no exported fields, while UUID
would be encoded as a string. However, with extension support, you can
encode any of these however you like.

## RPC

RPC Client and Server Codecs are implemented, so the codecs can be used
with the standard net/rpc package.

## Usage

Typical usage model:

    // create and configure Handle
    var (
      bh codec.BincHandle
      mh codec.MsgpackHandle
      ch codec.CborHandle
    )

    mh.MapType = reflect.TypeOf(map[string]interface{}(nil))

    // configure extensions
    // e.g. for msgpack, define functions and enable Time support for tag 1
    // mh.SetExt(reflect.TypeOf(time.Time{}), 1, myExt)

    // create and use decoder/encoder
    var (
      r io.Reader
      w io.Writer
      b []byte
      h = &bh // or mh to use msgpack
    )

    dec = codec.NewDecoder(r, h)
    dec = codec.NewDecoderBytes(b, h)
    err = dec.Decode(&v)

    enc = codec.NewEncoder(w, h)
    enc = codec.NewEncoderBytes(&b, h)
    err = enc.Encode(v)

    //RPC Server
    go func() {
        for {
            conn, err := listener.Accept()
            rpcCodec := codec.GoRpc.ServerCodec(conn, h)
            //OR rpcCodec := codec.MsgpackSpecRpc.ServerCodec(conn, h)
            rpc.ServeCodec(rpcCodec)
        }
    }()

    //RPC Communication (client side)
    conn, err = net.Dial("tcp", "localhost:5555")
    rpcCodec := codec.GoRpc.ClientCodec(conn, h)
    //OR rpcCodec := codec.MsgpackSpecRpc.ClientCodec(conn, h)
    client := rpc.NewClientWithCodec(rpcCodec)

# codecgen tool

Generate is given a list of *.go files to parse, and an output file (fout),
codecgen will create an output file __file.go__ which
contains `codec.Selfer` implementations for the named types found
in the files parsed.

Using codecgen is very straightforward.

**Download and install the tool**

`go get -u github.com/ugorji/go/codec/codecgen`

**Run the tool on your files**

The command line format is:

`codecgen [options] (-o outfile) (infile ...)`

```sh
% codecgen -?
Usage of codecgen:
  -c="github.com/ugorji/go/codec": codec path
  -o="": out file
  -r=".*": regex for type name to match
  -nr="": regex for type name to exclude
  -rt="": tags for go run
  -t="": build tag to put in file
  -u=false: Use unsafe, e.g. to avoid unnecessary allocation on []byte->string
  -x=false: keep temp file

% codecgen -o values_codecgen.go values.go values2.go moretypedefs.go
```

Please see the [blog article](http://ugorji.net/blog/go-codecgen)
for more information on how to use the tool.

# etcd/client

etcd/client is the Go client library for etcd.

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/coreos/etcd/client?status.png)](https://godoc.org/github.com/coreos/etcd/client)

## Install

```bash
go get github.com/coreos/etcd/client
```

## Usage

```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"time"

	"github.com/coreos/etcd/Godeps/_workspace/src/golang.org/x/net/context"
	"github.com/coreos/etcd/client"
)

func main() {
	cfg := client.Config{
		Endpoints:               []string{"http://127.0.0.1:2379"},
		Transport:               client.DefaultTransport,
		// set timeout per request to fail fast when the target endpoint is unavailable
		HeaderTimeoutPerRequest: time.Second,
	}
	c, err := client.New(cfg)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	kapi := client.NewKeysAPI(c)
	// set "/foo" key with "bar" value
	log.Print("Setting '/foo' key with 'bar' value")
	resp, err := kapi.Set(context.Background(), "/foo", "bar", nil)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	} else {
		// print common key info
		log.Printf("Set is done. Metadata is %q\n", resp)
	}
	// get "/foo" key's value
	log.Print("Getting '/foo' key value")
	resp, err = kapi.Get(context.Background(), "/foo", nil)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	} else {
		// print common key info
		log.Printf("Get is done. Metadata is %q\n", resp)
		// print value
		log.Printf("%q key has %q value\n", resp.Node.Key, resp.Node.Value)
	}
}
```

## Error Handling

etcd client might return three types of errors.

- context error

Each API call has its first parameter as `context`. A context can be canceled or have an attached deadline. If the context is canceled or reaches its deadline, the responding context error will be returned no matter what internal errors the API call has already encountered.

- cluster error

Each API call tries to send request to the cluster endpoints one by one until it successfully gets a response. If a requests to an endpoint fails, due to exceeding per request timeout or connection issues, the error will be added into a list of errors. If all possible endpoints fail, a cluster error that includes all encountered errors will be returned.

- response error

If the response gets from the cluster is invalid, a plain string error will be returned. For example, it might be a invalid JSON error.

Here is the example code to handle client errors:

```go
cfg := client.Config{Endpoints: []string{"http://etcd1:2379","http://etcd2:2379","http://etcd3:2379"}}
c, err := client.New(cfg)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}

kapi := client.NewKeysAPI(c)
resp, err := kapi.Set(ctx, "test", "bar", nil)
if err != nil {
	if err == context.Canceled {
		// ctx is canceled by another routine
	} else if err == context.DeadlineExceeded {
		// ctx is attached with a deadline and it exceeded
	} else if cerr, ok := err.(*client.ClusterError); ok {
		// process (cerr.Errors)
	} else {
		// bad cluster endpoints, which are not etcd servers
	}
}
```


## Caveat

1. etcd/client prefers to use the same endpoint as long as the endpoint continues to work well. This saves socket resources, and improves efficiency for both client and server side. This preference doesn't remove consistency from the data consumed by the client because data replicated to each etcd member has already passed through the consensus process.

2. etcd/client does round-robin rotation on other available endpoints if the preferred endpoint isn't functioning properly. For example, if the member that etcd/client connects to is hard killed, etcd/client will fail on the first attempt with the killed member, and succeed on the second attempt with another member. If it fails to talk to all available endpoints, it will return all errors happened.

3. Default etcd/client cannot handle the case that the remote server is SIGSTOPed now. TCP keepalive mechanism doesn't help in this scenario because operating system may still send TCP keep-alive packets. Over time we'd like to improve this functionality, but solving this issue isn't high priority because a real-life case in which a server is stopped, but the connection is kept alive, hasn't been brought to our attention.

4. etcd/client cannot detect whether the member in use is healthy when doing read requests. If the member is isolated from the cluster, etcd/client may retrieve outdated data. As a workaround, users could monitor experimental /health endpoint for member healthy information. We are improving it at [#3265](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/issues/3265).
# Store
Storage layer of redis framework, this will give MrRedis the ability to remember things permanently.  

There are two types of objects this framework will persist.
* (Redis) Proc
* (Redis) Service Instance


### Redis Proc
A `redis-server` process running in any of the `mesos-slave` is called a **Redis Proc** (Redis Process). 

A Redis **Proc** has the following properties
* In the datacenter each Proc is identified by a UID
* It belongs to a Service Instance
* It binds to a particular port
* It can either be a Redis Master or a Redis Slave
* It has a **PID**
* It is monitored by Redis Monitor **(REDMON)** 
* **REDMON** updates the statistically information about this **PROC** periodically



### Redis Service Instance

A logical representation of the service instance that encapsulates one or more Redis **Proc** 

A Service Instance can be of the following type
* **Single Instance**:	Contains one redis **Proc** exposes an IP/Port
* **Master-Slave**:	Contains one `Proc` as master and rest of the redis `Proc`s as slaves
* **Cluster**: `Future Work when support of Redis 3.0 Cluster is added`

This is identical to **POD** terminology in K8s, we could group one or more **Proc**s as one unit, they are created and monitored together. 

***PS:*** *For convenience we will loose the obvious prefix 'Redis' and simple call `Service Instance` and `Proc` in the rest of the project*

### Considerations

It has been decided to use `etcd` as data store backend initially.  More support of other DB to be added later.

# cli.go

`cli.go` is simple, fast, and fun package for building command line apps in Go. The goal is to enable developers to write fast and distributable command line applications in an expressive way.

## Overview

Command line apps are usually so tiny that there is absolutely no reason why your code should *not* be self-documenting. Things like generating help text and parsing command flags/options should not hinder productivity when writing a command line app.

**This is where `cli.go` comes into play.** `cli.go` makes command line programming fun, organized, and expressive!

## Installation

Make sure you have a working Go environment (go 1.1+ is *required*). [See the install instructions](http://golang.org/doc/install.html).

To install `cli.go`, simply run:
```
$ go get github.com/codegangsta/cli
```

Make sure your `PATH` includes to the `$GOPATH/bin` directory so your commands can be easily used:
```
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
```

## Getting Started

One of the philosophies behind `cli.go` is that an API should be playful and full of discovery. So a `cli.go` app can be as little as one line of code in `main()`. 

``` go
package main

import (
  "os"
  "github.com/codegangsta/cli"
)

func main() {
  cli.NewApp().Run(os.Args)
}
```

This app will run and show help text, but is not very useful. Let's give an action to execute and some help documentation:

``` go
package main

import (
  "os"
  "github.com/codegangsta/cli"
)

func main() {
  app := cli.NewApp()
  app.Name = "boom"
  app.Usage = "make an explosive entrance"
  app.Action = func(c *cli.Context) {
    println("boom! I say!")
  }
  
  app.Run(os.Args)
}
```

Running this already gives you a ton of functionality, plus support for things like subcommands and flags, which are covered below.

## Example

Being a programmer can be a lonely job. Thankfully by the power of automation that is not the case! Let's create a greeter app to fend off our demons of loneliness!

Start by creating a directory named `greet`, and within it, add a file, `greet.go` with the following code in it:

``` go
package main

import (
  "os"
  "github.com/codegangsta/cli"
)

func main() {
  app := cli.NewApp()
  app.Name = "greet"
  app.Usage = "fight the loneliness!"
  app.Action = func(c *cli.Context) {
    println("Hello friend!")
  }

  app.Run(os.Args)
}
```

Install our command to the `$GOPATH/bin` directory:

```
$ go install
```

Finally run our new command:

```
$ greet
Hello friend!
```

`cli.go` also generates neat help text:

```
$ greet help
NAME:
    greet - fight the loneliness!

USAGE:
    greet [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]

VERSION:
    0.0.0

COMMANDS:
    help, h  Shows a list of commands or help for one command

GLOBAL OPTIONS
    --version	Shows version information
```

### Arguments

You can lookup arguments by calling the `Args` function on `cli.Context`.

``` go
...
app.Action = func(c *cli.Context) {
  println("Hello", c.Args()[0])
}
...
```

### Flags

Setting and querying flags is simple.

``` go
...
app.Flags = []cli.Flag {
  cli.StringFlag{
    Name: "lang",
    Value: "english",
    Usage: "language for the greeting",
  },
}
app.Action = func(c *cli.Context) {
  name := "someone"
  if len(c.Args()) > 0 {
    name = c.Args()[0]
  }
  if c.String("lang") == "spanish" {
    println("Hola", name)
  } else {
    println("Hello", name)
  }
}
...
```

You can also set a destination variable for a flag, to which the content will be scanned.

``` go
...
var language string
app.Flags = []cli.Flag {
  cli.StringFlag{
    Name:        "lang",
    Value:       "english",
    Usage:       "language for the greeting",
    Destination: &language,
  },
}
app.Action = func(c *cli.Context) {
  name := "someone"
  if len(c.Args()) > 0 {
    name = c.Args()[0]
  }
  if language == "spanish" {
    println("Hola", name)
  } else {
    println("Hello", name)
  }
}
...
```

See full list of flags at http://godoc.org/github.com/codegangsta/cli

#### Alternate Names

You can set alternate (or short) names for flags by providing a comma-delimited list for the `Name`. e.g.

``` go
app.Flags = []cli.Flag {
  cli.StringFlag{
    Name: "lang, l",
    Value: "english",
    Usage: "language for the greeting",
  },
}
```

That flag can then be set with `--lang spanish` or `-l spanish`. Note that giving two different forms of the same flag in the same command invocation is an error.

#### Values from the Environment

You can also have the default value set from the environment via `EnvVar`.  e.g.

``` go
app.Flags = []cli.Flag {
  cli.StringFlag{
    Name: "lang, l",
    Value: "english",
    Usage: "language for the greeting",
    EnvVar: "APP_LANG",
  },
}
```

The `EnvVar` may also be given as a comma-delimited "cascade", where the first environment variable that resolves is used as the default.

``` go
app.Flags = []cli.Flag {
  cli.StringFlag{
    Name: "lang, l",
    Value: "english",
    Usage: "language for the greeting",
    EnvVar: "LEGACY_COMPAT_LANG,APP_LANG,LANG",
  },
}
```

### Subcommands

Subcommands can be defined for a more git-like command line app.

```go
...
app.Commands = []cli.Command{
  {
    Name:      "add",
    Aliases:     []string{"a"},
    Usage:     "add a task to the list",
    Action: func(c *cli.Context) {
      println("added task: ", c.Args().First())
    },
  },
  {
    Name:      "complete",
    Aliases:     []string{"c"},
    Usage:     "complete a task on the list",
    Action: func(c *cli.Context) {
      println("completed task: ", c.Args().First())
    },
  },
  {
    Name:      "template",
    Aliases:     []string{"r"},
    Usage:     "options for task templates",
    Subcommands: []cli.Command{
      {
        Name:  "add",
        Usage: "add a new template",
        Action: func(c *cli.Context) {
            println("new task template: ", c.Args().First())
        },
      },
      {
        Name:  "remove",
        Usage: "remove an existing template",
        Action: func(c *cli.Context) {
          println("removed task template: ", c.Args().First())
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
...
```

### Bash Completion

You can enable completion commands by setting the `EnableBashCompletion`
flag on the `App` object.  By default, this setting will only auto-complete to
show an app's subcommands, but you can write your own completion methods for
the App or its subcommands.

```go
...
var tasks = []string{"cook", "clean", "laundry", "eat", "sleep", "code"}
app := cli.NewApp()
app.EnableBashCompletion = true
app.Commands = []cli.Command{
  {
    Name:  "complete",
    Aliases: []string{"c"},
    Usage: "complete a task on the list",
    Action: func(c *cli.Context) {
       println("completed task: ", c.Args().First())
    },
    BashComplete: func(c *cli.Context) {
      // This will complete if no args are passed
      if len(c.Args()) > 0 {
        return
      }
      for _, t := range tasks {
        fmt.Println(t)
      }
    },
  }
}
...
```

#### To Enable

Source the `autocomplete/bash_autocomplete` file in your `.bashrc` file while
setting the `PROG` variable to the name of your program:

`PROG=myprogram source /.../cli/autocomplete/bash_autocomplete`

#### To Distribute

Copy `autocomplete/bash_autocomplete` into `/etc/bash_completion.d/` and rename
it to the name of the program you wish to add autocomplete support for (or
automatically install it there if you are distributing a package). Don't forget
to source the file to make it active in the current shell.

```
sudo cp src/bash_autocomplete /etc/bash_completion.d/<myprogram>
source /etc/bash_completion.d/<myprogram>
```

Alternatively, you can just document that users should source the generic
`autocomplete/bash_autocomplete` in their bash configuration with `$PROG` set
to the name of their program (as above).

## Contribution Guidelines

Feel free to put up a pull request to fix a bug or maybe add a feature. I will give it a code review and make sure that it does not break backwards compatibility. If I or any other collaborators agree that it is in line with the vision of the project, we will work with you to get the code into a mergeable state and merge it into the master branch.

If you have contributed something significant to the project, I will most likely add you as a collaborator. As a collaborator you are given the ability to merge others pull requests. It is very important that new code does not break existing code, so be careful about what code you do choose to merge. If you have any questions feel free to link @codegangsta to the issue in question and we can review it together.

If you feel like you have contributed to the project but have not yet been added as a collaborator, I probably forgot to add you. Hit @codegangsta up over email and we will get it figured out.

	fmt.Println(pong, err)
	// Output: PONG <nil>
}

func ExampleClient() {
	err := client.Set("key", "value", 0).Err()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	val, err := client.Get("key").Result()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)

	fmt.Println("key", val)

	val2, err := client.Get("key2").Result()
	if err == redis.Nil {
		fmt.Println("key2 does not exists")
	} else if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	} else {
		fmt.Println("key2", val2)
	}
	// Output: key value
	// key2 does not exists
}
```

## Howto

Please go through [examples](http://godoc.org/gopkg.in/redis.v3#pkg-examples) to get an idea how to use this package.

## Look and feel

Some corner cases:

    SET key value EX 10 NX
    set, err := client.SetNX("key", "value", 10*time.Second).Result()

    SORT list LIMIT 0 2 ASC
    vals, err := client.Sort("list", redis.Sort{Offset: 0, Count: 2, Order: "ASC"}).Result()

    ZRANGEBYSCORE zset -inf +inf WITHSCORES LIMIT 0 2
    vals, err := client.ZRangeByScoreWithScores("zset", redis.ZRangeByScore{
        Min: "-inf",
        Max: "+inf",
        Offset: 0,
        Count: 2,
    }).Result()

    ZINTERSTORE out 2 zset1 zset2 WEIGHTS 2 3 AGGREGATE SUM
    vals, err := client.ZInterStore("out", redis.ZStore{Weights: []int64{2, 3}}, "zset1", "zset2").Result()

    EVAL "return {KEYS[1],ARGV[1]}" 1 "key" "hello"
    vals, err := client.Eval("return {KEYS[1],ARGV[1]}", []string{"key"}, []string{"hello"}).Result()

# Codec

High Performance, Feature-Rich Idiomatic Go codec/encoding library for
binc, msgpack, cbor, json.

Supported Serialization formats are:

  - msgpack: https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack
  - binc:    http://github.com/ugorji/binc
  - cbor:    http://cbor.io http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049
  - json:    http://json.org http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159
  - simple: 

To install:

    go get github.com/ugorji/go/codec

This package understands the `unsafe` tag, to allow using unsafe semantics:

  - When decoding into a struct, you need to read the field name as a string 
    so you can find the struct field it is mapped to.
    Using `unsafe` will bypass the allocation and copying overhead of `[]byte->string` conversion.

To use it, you must pass the `unsafe` tag during install:

```
go install -tags=unsafe github.com/ugorji/go/codec 
```

Online documentation: http://godoc.org/github.com/ugorji/go/codec  
Detailed Usage/How-to Primer: http://ugorji.net/blog/go-codec-primer

The idiomatic Go support is as seen in other encoding packages in
the standard library (ie json, xml, gob, etc).

Rich Feature Set includes:

  - Simple but extremely powerful and feature-rich API
  - Very High Performance.
    Our extensive benchmarks show us outperforming Gob, Json, Bson, etc by 2-4X.
  - Multiple conversions:
    Package coerces types where appropriate 
    e.g. decode an int in the stream into a float, etc.
  - Corner Cases: 
    Overflows, nil maps/slices, nil values in streams are handled correctly
  - Standard field renaming via tags
  - Support for omitting empty fields during an encoding
  - Encoding from any value and decoding into pointer to any value
    (struct, slice, map, primitives, pointers, interface{}, etc)
  - Extensions to support efficient encoding/decoding of any named types
  - Support encoding.(Binary|Text)(M|Unm)arshaler interfaces
  - Decoding without a schema (into a interface{}).
    Includes Options to configure what specific map or slice type to use
    when decoding an encoded list or map into a nil interface{}
  - Encode a struct as an array, and decode struct from an array in the data stream
  - Comprehensive support for anonymous fields
  - Fast (no-reflection) encoding/decoding of common maps and slices
  - Code-generation for faster performance.
  - Support binary (e.g. messagepack, cbor) and text (e.g. json) formats
  - Support indefinite-length formats to enable true streaming 
    (for formats which support it e.g. json, cbor)
  - Support canonical encoding, where a value is ALWAYS encoded as same sequence of bytes.
    This mostly applies to maps, where iteration order is non-deterministic.
  - NIL in data stream decoded as zero value
  - Never silently skip data when decoding.
    User decides whether to return an error or silently skip data when keys or indexes
    in the data stream do not map to fields in the struct.
  - Encode/Decode from/to chan types (for iterative streaming support)
  - Drop-in replacement for encoding/json. `json:` key in struct tag supported.
  - Provides a RPC Server and Client Codec for net/rpc communication protocol.
  - Handle unique idiosynchracies of codecs e.g. 
    - For messagepack, configure how ambiguities in handling raw bytes are resolved 
    - For messagepack, provide rpc server/client codec to support
      msgpack-rpc protocol defined at:
      https://github.com/msgpack-rpc/msgpack-rpc/blob/master/spec.md

## Extension Support

Users can register a function to handle the encoding or decoding of
their custom types.

There are no restrictions on what the custom type can be. Some examples:

    type BisSet   []int
    type BitSet64 uint64
    type UUID     string
    type MyStructWithUnexportedFields struct { a int; b bool; c []int; }
    type GifImage struct { ... }

As an illustration, MyStructWithUnexportedFields would normally be
encoded as an empty map because it has no exported fields, while UUID
would be encoded as a string. However, with extension support, you can
encode any of these however you like.

## RPC

RPC Client and Server Codecs are implemented, so the codecs can be used
with the standard net/rpc package.

## Usage

Typical usage model:

    // create and configure Handle
    var (
      bh codec.BincHandle
      mh codec.MsgpackHandle
      ch codec.CborHandle
    )

    mh.MapType = reflect.TypeOf(map[string]interface{}(nil))

    // configure extensions
    // e.g. for msgpack, define functions and enable Time support for tag 1
    // mh.SetExt(reflect.TypeOf(time.Time{}), 1, myExt)

    // create and use decoder/encoder
    var (
      r io.Reader
      w io.Writer
      b []byte
      h = &bh // or mh to use msgpack
    )

    dec = codec.NewDecoder(r, h)
    dec = codec.NewDecoderBytes(b, h)
    err = dec.Decode(&v)

    enc = codec.NewEncoder(w, h)
    enc = codec.NewEncoderBytes(&b, h)
    err = enc.Encode(v)

    //RPC Server
    go func() {
        for {
            conn, err := listener.Accept()
            rpcCodec := codec.GoRpc.ServerCodec(conn, h)
            //OR rpcCodec := codec.MsgpackSpecRpc.ServerCodec(conn, h)
            rpc.ServeCodec(rpcCodec)
        }
    }()

    //RPC Communication (client side)
    conn, err = net.Dial("tcp", "localhost:5555")
    rpcCodec := codec.GoRpc.ClientCodec(conn, h)
    //OR rpcCodec := codec.MsgpackSpecRpc.ClientCodec(conn, h)
    client := rpc.NewClientWithCodec(rpcCodec)

# codecgen tool

Generate is given a list of *.go files to parse, and an output file (fout),
codecgen will create an output file __file.go__ which
contains `codec.Selfer` implementations for the named types found
in the files parsed.

Using codecgen is very straightforward.

**Download and install the tool**

`go get -u github.com/ugorji/go/codec/codecgen`

**Run the tool on your files**

The command line format is:

`codecgen [options] (-o outfile) (infile ...)`

```sh
% codecgen -?
Usage of codecgen:
  -c="github.com/ugorji/go/codec": codec path
  -o="": out file
  -r=".*": regex for type name to match
  -nr="": regex for type name to exclude
  -rt="": tags for go run
  -t="": build tag to put in file
  -u=false: Use unsafe, e.g. to avoid unnecessary allocation on []byte->string
  -x=false: keep temp file

% codecgen -o values_codecgen.go values.go values2.go moretypedefs.go
```

Please see the [blog article](http://ugorji.net/blog/go-codecgen)
for more information on how to use the tool.

# etcd/client

etcd/client is the Go client library for etcd.

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/coreos/etcd/client?status.png)](https://godoc.org/github.com/coreos/etcd/client)

## Install

```bash
go get github.com/coreos/etcd/client
```

## Usage

```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"time"

	"github.com/coreos/etcd/Godeps/_workspace/src/golang.org/x/net/context"
	"github.com/coreos/etcd/client"
)

func main() {
	cfg := client.Config{
		Endpoints:               []string{"http://127.0.0.1:2379"},
		Transport:               client.DefaultTransport,
		// set timeout per request to fail fast when the target endpoint is unavailable
		HeaderTimeoutPerRequest: time.Second,
	}
	c, err := client.New(cfg)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	kapi := client.NewKeysAPI(c)
	// set "/foo" key with "bar" value
	log.Print("Setting '/foo' key with 'bar' value")
	resp, err := kapi.Set(context.Background(), "/foo", "bar", nil)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	} else {
		// print common key info
		log.Printf("Set is done. Metadata is %q\n", resp)
	}
	// get "/foo" key's value
	log.Print("Getting '/foo' key value")
	resp, err = kapi.Get(context.Background(), "/foo", nil)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	} else {
		// print common key info
		log.Printf("Get is done. Metadata is %q\n", resp)
		// print value
		log.Printf("%q key has %q value\n", resp.Node.Key, resp.Node.Value)
	}
}
```

## Error Handling

etcd client might return three types of errors.

- context error

Each API call has its first parameter as `context`. A context can be canceled or have an attached deadline. If the context is canceled or reaches its deadline, the responding context error will be returned no matter what internal errors the API call has already encountered.

- cluster error

Each API call tries to send request to the cluster endpoints one by one until it successfully gets a response. If a requests to an endpoint fails, due to exceeding per request timeout or connection issues, the error will be added into a list of errors. If all possible endpoints fail, a cluster error that includes all encountered errors will be returned.

- response error

If the response gets from the cluster is invalid, a plain string error will be returned. For example, it might be a invalid JSON error.

Here is the example code to handle client errors:

```go
cfg := client.Config{Endpoints: []string{"http://etcd1:2379","http://etcd2:2379","http://etcd3:2379"}}
c, err := client.New(cfg)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}

kapi := client.NewKeysAPI(c)
resp, err := kapi.Set(ctx, "test", "bar", nil)
if err != nil {
	if err == context.Canceled {
		// ctx is canceled by another routine
	} else if err == context.DeadlineExceeded {
		// ctx is attached with a deadline and it exceeded
	} else if cerr, ok := err.(*client.ClusterError); ok {
		// process (cerr.Errors)
	} else {
		// bad cluster endpoints, which are not etcd servers
	}
}
```


## Caveat

1. etcd/client prefers to use the same endpoint as long as the endpoint continues to work well. This saves socket resources, and improves efficiency for both client and server side. This preference doesn't remove consistency from the data consumed by the client because data replicated to each etcd member has already passed through the consensus process.

2. etcd/client does round-robin rotation on other available endpoints if the preferred endpoint isn't functioning properly. For example, if the member that etcd/client connects to is hard killed, etcd/client will fail on the first attempt with the killed member, and succeed on the second attempt with another member. If it fails to talk to all available endpoints, it will return all errors happened.

3. Default etcd/client cannot handle the case that the remote server is SIGSTOPed now. TCP keepalive mechanism doesn't help in this scenario because operating system may still send TCP keep-alive packets. Over time we'd like to improve this functionality, but solving this issue isn't high priority because a real-life case in which a server is stopped, but the connection is kept alive, hasn't been brought to our attention.

4. etcd/client cannot detect whether the member in use is healthy when doing read requests. If the member is isolated from the cluster, etcd/client may retrieve outdated data. As a workaround, users could monitor experimental /health endpoint for member healthy information. We are improving it at [#3265](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/issues/3265).
# errors [![Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/pkg/errors.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/pkg/errors) [![AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/b98mptawhudj53ep/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/davecheney/errors/branch/master) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/pkg/errors?status.svg)](http://godoc.org/github.com/pkg/errors) [![Report card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/pkg/errors)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/pkg/errors)

Package errors provides simple error handling primitives.

`go get github.com/pkg/errors`

The traditional error handling idiom in Go is roughly akin to
```go
if err != nil {
        return err
}
```
which applied recursively up the call stack results in error reports without context or debugging information. The errors package allows programmers to add context to the failure path in their code in a way that does not destroy the original value of the error.

## Adding context to an error

The errors.Wrap function returns a new error that adds context to the original error. For example
```go
_, err := ioutil.ReadAll(r)
if err != nil {
        return errors.Wrap(err, "read failed")
}
```
## Retrieving the cause of an error

Using `errors.Wrap` constructs a stack of errors, adding context to the preceding error. Depending on the nature of the error it may be necessary to reverse the operation of errors.Wrap to retrieve the original error for inspection. Any error value which implements this interface can be inspected by `errors.Cause`.
```go
type causer interface {
        Cause() error
}
```
`errors.Cause` will recursively retrieve the topmost error which does not implement `causer`, which is assumed to be the original cause. For example:
```go
switch err := errors.Cause(err).(type) {
case *MyError:
        // handle specifically
default:
        // unknown error
}
```

glog
====

Leveled execution logs for Go.

This is an efficient pure Go implementation of leveled logs in the
manner of the open source C++ package
	http://code.google.com/p/google-glog

By binding methods to booleans it is possible to use the log package
without paying the expense of evaluating the arguments to the log.
Through the -vmodule flag, the package also provides fine-grained
control over logging at the file level.

The comment from glog.go introduces the ideas:

	Package glog implements logging analogous to the Google-internal
	C++ INFO/ERROR/V setup.  It provides functions Info, Warning,
	Error, Fatal, plus formatting variants such as Infof. It
	also provides V-style logging controlled by the -v and
	-vmodule=file=2 flags.
	
	Basic examples:
	
		glog.Info("Prepare to repel boarders")
	
		glog.Fatalf("Initialization failed: %s", err)
	
	See the documentation for the V function for an explanation
	of these examples:
	
		if glog.V(2) {
			glog.Info("Starting transaction...")
		}
	
		glog.V(2).Infoln("Processed", nItems, "elements")


The repository contains an open source version of the log package
used inside Google. The master copy of the source lives inside
Google, not here. The code in this repo is for export only and is not itself
under development. Feature requests will be ignored.

# go-winio

This repository contains utilities for efficiently performing Win32 IO operations in
Go. Currently, this is focused on accessing named pipes and other file handles, and
for using named pipes as a net transport.

This code relies on IO completion ports to avoid blocking IO on system threads, allowing Go
to reuse the thread to schedule another goroutine. This limits support to Windows Vista and
newer operating systems. This is similar to the implementation of network sockets in Go's net
package.

# Logrus <img src="http://i.imgur.com/hTeVwmJ.png" width="40" height="40" alt=":walrus:" class="emoji" title=":walrus:"/>&nbsp;[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Sirupsen/logrus.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Sirupsen/logrus)&nbsp;[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/Sirupsen/logrus?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/Sirupsen/logrus)

Logrus is a structured logger for Go (golang), completely API compatible with
the standard library logger. [Godoc][godoc]. **Please note the Logrus API is not
yet stable (pre 1.0). Logrus itself is completely stable and has been used in
many large deployments. The core API is unlikely to change much but please
version control your Logrus to make sure you aren't fetching latest `master` on
every build.**

Nicely color-coded in development (when a TTY is attached, otherwise just
plain text):

![Colored](http://i.imgur.com/PY7qMwd.png)

With `log.SetFormatter(&log.JSONFormatter{})`, for easy parsing by logstash
or Splunk:

```json
{"animal":"walrus","level":"info","msg":"A group of walrus emerges from the
ocean","size":10,"time":"2014-03-10 19:57:38.562264131 -0400 EDT"}

{"level":"warning","msg":"The group's number increased tremendously!",
"number":122,"omg":true,"time":"2014-03-10 19:57:38.562471297 -0400 EDT"}

{"animal":"walrus","level":"info","msg":"A giant walrus appears!",
"size":10,"time":"2014-03-10 19:57:38.562500591 -0400 EDT"}

{"animal":"walrus","level":"info","msg":"Tremendously sized cow enters the ocean.",
"size":9,"time":"2014-03-10 19:57:38.562527896 -0400 EDT"}

{"level":"fatal","msg":"The ice breaks!","number":100,"omg":true,
"time":"2014-03-10 19:57:38.562543128 -0400 EDT"}
```

With the default `log.SetFormatter(&log.TextFormatter{})` when a TTY is not
attached, the output is compatible with the
[logfmt](http://godoc.org/github.com/kr/logfmt) format:

```text
time="2015-03-26T01:27:38-04:00" level=debug msg="Started observing beach" animal=walrus number=8
time="2015-03-26T01:27:38-04:00" level=info msg="A group of walrus emerges from the ocean" animal=walrus size=10

exit status 1
```

#### Example

The simplest way to use Logrus is simply the package-level exported logger:

```go
package main

import (
  log "github.com/Sirupsen/logrus"
)

func main() {
  log.WithFields(log.Fields{
    "animal": "walrus",
  }).Info("A walrus appears")
}
```

Note that it's completely api-compatible with the stdlib logger, so you can
replace your `log` imports everywhere with `log "github.com/Sirupsen/logrus"`
and you'll now have the flexibility of Logrus. You can customize it all you
want:

```go
package main

import (
  "os"
  log "github.com/Sirupsen/logrus"
)

func init() {
  // Log as JSON instead of the default ASCII formatter.
  log.SetFormatter(&log.JSONFormatter{})

  // Output to stderr instead of stdout, could also be a file.
  log.SetOutput(os.Stderr)

  // Only log the warning severity or above.
  log.SetLevel(log.WarnLevel)
}

func main() {
  log.WithFields(log.Fields{
    "animal": "walrus",
    "size":   10,
  }).Info("A group of walrus emerges from the ocean")

  log.WithFields(log.Fields{
    "omg":    true,
    "number": 122,
  }).Warn("The group's number increased tremendously!")

  log.WithFields(log.Fields{
    "omg":    true,
    "number": 100,
  }).Fatal("The ice breaks!")

  // A common pattern is to re-use fields between logging statements by re-using
  // the logrus.Entry returned from WithFields()
  contextLogger := log.WithFields(log.Fields{
    "common": "this is a common field",
    "other": "I also should be logged always",
  })

  contextLogger.Info("I'll be logged with common and other field")
  contextLogger.Info("Me too")
}
```

For more advanced usage such as logging to multiple locations from the same
application, you can also create an instance of the `logrus` Logger:

```go
package main

import (
  "github.com/Sirupsen/logrus"
)

// Create a new instance of the logger. You can have any number of instances.
var log = logrus.New()

func main() {
  // The API for setting attributes is a little different than the package level
  // exported logger. See Godoc.
  log.Out = os.Stderr

  log.WithFields(logrus.Fields{
    "animal": "walrus",
    "size":   10,
  }).Info("A group of walrus emerges from the ocean")
}
```

#### Fields

Logrus encourages careful, structured logging though logging fields instead of
long, unparseable error messages. For example, instead of: `log.Fatalf("Failed
to send event %s to topic %s with key %d")`, you should log the much more
discoverable:

```go
log.WithFields(log.Fields{
  "event": event,
  "topic": topic,
  "key": key,
}).Fatal("Failed to send event")
```

We've found this API forces you to think about logging in a way that produces
much more useful logging messages. We've been in countless situations where just
a single added field to a log statement that was already there would've saved us
hours. The `WithFields` call is optional.

In general, with Logrus using any of the `printf`-family functions should be
seen as a hint you should add a field, however, you can still use the
`printf`-family functions with Logrus.

#### Hooks

You can add hooks for logging levels. For example to send errors to an exception
tracking service on `Error`, `Fatal` and `Panic`, info to StatsD or log to
multiple places simultaneously, e.g. syslog.

Logrus comes with [built-in hooks](hooks/). Add those, or your custom hook, in
`init`:

```go
import (
  log "github.com/Sirupsen/logrus"
  "gopkg.in/gemnasium/logrus-airbrake-hook.v2" // the package is named "aibrake"
  logrus_syslog "github.com/Sirupsen/logrus/hooks/syslog"
  "log/syslog"
)

func init() {

  // Use the Airbrake hook to report errors that have Error severity or above to
  // an exception tracker. You can create custom hooks, see the Hooks section.
  log.AddHook(airbrake.NewHook(123, "xyz", "production"))

  hook, err := logrus_syslog.NewSyslogHook("udp", "localhost:514", syslog.LOG_INFO, "")
  if err != nil {
    log.Error("Unable to connect to local syslog daemon")
  } else {
    log.AddHook(hook)
  }
}
```
Note: Syslog hook also support connecting to local syslog (Ex. "/dev/log" or "/var/run/syslog" or "/var/run/log"). For the detail, please check the [syslog hook README](hooks/syslog/README.md).

#### Level logging

Logrus has six logging levels: Debug, Info, Warning, Error, Fatal and Panic.

```go
log.Debug("Useful debugging information.")
log.Info("Something noteworthy happened!")
log.Warn("You should probably take a look at this.")
log.Error("Something failed but I'm not quitting.")
// Calls os.Exit(1) after logging
log.Fatal("Bye.")
// Calls panic() after logging
log.Panic("I'm bailing.")
```

You can set the logging level on a `Logger`, then it will only log entries with
that severity or anything above it:

```go
// Will log anything that is info or above (warn, error, fatal, panic). Default.
log.SetLevel(log.InfoLevel)
```

It may be useful to set `log.Level = logrus.DebugLevel` in a debug or verbose
environment if your application has that.

#### Entries

Besides the fields added with `WithField` or `WithFields` some fields are
automatically added to all logging events:

1. `time`. The timestamp when the entry was created.
2. `msg`. The logging message passed to `{Info,Warn,Error,Fatal,Panic}` after
   the `AddFields` call. E.g. `Failed to send event.`
3. `level`. The logging level. E.g. `info`.

#### Environments

Logrus has no notion of environment.

If you wish for hooks and formatters to only be used in specific environments,
you should handle that yourself. For example, if your application has a global
variable `Environment`, which is a string representation of the environment you
could do:

```go
import (
  log "github.com/Sirupsen/logrus"
)

init() {
  // do something here to set environment depending on an environment variable
  // or command-line flag
  if Environment == "production" {
    log.SetFormatter(&log.JSONFormatter{})
  } else {
    // The TextFormatter is default, you don't actually have to do this.
    log.SetFormatter(&log.TextFormatter{})
  }
}
```

This configuration is how `logrus` was intended to be used, but JSON in
production is mostly only useful if you do log aggregation with tools like
Splunk or Logstash.

#### Formatters

The built-in logging formatters are:

* `logrus.TextFormatter`. Logs the event in colors if stdout is a tty, otherwise
  without colors.
  * *Note:* to force colored output when there is no TTY, set the `ForceColors`
    field to `true`.  To force no colored output even if there is a TTY  set the
    `DisableColors` field to `true`
* `logrus.JSONFormatter`. Logs fields as JSON.

Third party logging formatters:

* [`logstash`](https://github.com/bshuster-repo/logrus-logstash-hook). Logs fields as [Logstash](http://logstash.net) Events.
* [`prefixed`](https://github.com/x-cray/logrus-prefixed-formatter). Displays log entry source along with alternative layout.
* [`zalgo`](https://github.com/aybabtme/logzalgo). Invoking the P͉̫o̳̼̊w̖͈̰͎e̬͔̭͂r͚̼̹̲ ̫͓͉̳͈ō̠͕͖̚f̝͍̠ ͕̲̞͖͑Z̖̫̤̫ͪa͉̬͈̗l͖͎g̳̥o̰̥̅!̣͔̲̻͊̄ ̙̘̦̹̦.

You can define your formatter by implementing the `Formatter` interface,
requiring a `Format` method. `Format` takes an `*Entry`. `entry.Data` is a
`Fields` type (`map[string]interface{}`) with all your fields as well as the
default ones (see Entries section above):

```go
type MyJSONFormatter struct {
}

log.SetFormatter(new(MyJSONFormatter))

func (f *MyJSONFormatter) Format(entry *Entry) ([]byte, error) {
  // Note this doesn't include Time, Level and Message which are available on
  // the Entry. Consult `godoc` on information about those fields or read the
  // source of the official loggers.
  serialized, err := json.Marshal(entry.Data)
    if err != nil {
      return nil, fmt.Errorf("Failed to marshal fields to JSON, %v", err)
    }
  return append(serialized, '\n'), nil
}
```

#### Logger as an `io.Writer`

Logrus can be transformed into an `io.Writer`. That writer is the end of an `io.Pipe` and it is your responsibility to close it.

```go
w := logger.Writer()
defer w.Close()

srv := http.Server{
    // create a stdlib log.Logger that writes to
    // logrus.Logger.
    ErrorLog: log.New(w, "", 0),
}
```

Each line written to that writer will be printed the usual way, using formatters
and hooks. The level for those entries is `info`.

#### Rotation

Log rotation is not provided with Logrus. Log rotation should be done by an
external program (like `logrotate(8)`) that can compress and delete old log
entries. It should not be a feature of the application-level logger.

#### Tools

| Tool | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
|[Logrus Mate](https://github.com/gogap/logrus_mate)|Logrus mate is a tool for Logrus to manage loggers, you can initial logger's level, hook and formatter by config file, the logger will generated with different config at different environment.|

#### Testing

Logrus has a built in facility for asserting the presence of log messages. This is implemented through the `test` hook and provides:

* decorators for existing logger (`test.NewLocal` and `test.NewGlobal`) which basically just add the `test` hook
* a test logger (`test.NewNullLogger`) that just records log messages (and does not output any):

```go
logger, hook := NewNullLogger()
logger.Error("Hello error")

assert.Equal(1, len(hook.Entries))
assert.Equal(logrus.ErrorLevel, hook.LastEntry().Level)
assert.Equal("Hello error", hook.LastEntry().Message)

hook.Reset()
assert.Nil(hook.LastEntry())
```

#### Fatal handlers

Logrus can register one or more functions that will be called when any `fatal`
level message is logged. The registered handlers will be executed before
logrus performs a `os.Exit(1)`. This behavior may be helpful if callers need
to gracefully shutdown. Unlike a `panic("Something went wrong...")` call which can be intercepted with a deferred `recover` a call to `os.Exit(1)` can not be intercepted.

```
...
handler := func() {
  // gracefully shutdown something...
}
logrus.RegisterExitHandler(handler)
...
```

#### Thread safty

By default Logger is protected by mutex for concurrent writes, this mutex is invoked when calling hooks and writing logs.
If you are sure such locking is not needed, you can call logger.SetNoLock() to disable the locking.

Situation when locking is not needed includes:

* You have no hooks registered, or hooks calling is already thread-safe.

* Writing to logger.Out is already thread-safe, for example:

  1) logger.Out is protected by locks.

  2) logger.Out is a os.File handler opened with `O_APPEND` flag, and every write is smaller than 4k. (This allow multi-thread/multi-process writing)

     (Refer to http://www.notthewizard.com/2014/06/17/are-files-appends-really-atomic/)
# Syslog Hooks for Logrus <img src="http://i.imgur.com/hTeVwmJ.png" width="40" height="40" alt=":walrus:" class="emoji" title=":walrus:"/>

## Usage

```go
import (
  "log/syslog"
  "github.com/Sirupsen/logrus"
  logrus_syslog "github.com/Sirupsen/logrus/hooks/syslog"
)

func main() {
  log       := logrus.New()
  hook, err := logrus_syslog.NewSyslogHook("udp", "localhost:514", syslog.LOG_INFO, "")

  if err == nil {
    log.Hooks.Add(hook)
  }
}
```

If you want to connect to local syslog (Ex. "/dev/log" or "/var/run/syslog" or "/var/run/log"). Just assign empty string to the first two parameters of `NewSyslogHook`. It should look like the following.

```go
import (
  "log/syslog"
  "github.com/Sirupsen/logrus"
  logrus_syslog "github.com/Sirupsen/logrus/hooks/syslog"
)

func main() {
  log       := logrus.New()
  hook, err := logrus_syslog.NewSyslogHook("", "", syslog.LOG_INFO, "")

  if err == nil {
    log.Hooks.Add(hook)
  }
}

# Introduction

go-units is a library to transform human friendly measurements into machine friendly values.

## Usage

See the [docs in godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/docker/go-units) for examples and documentation.

## Legacy API type versions

This package includes types for legacy API versions. The stable version of the API types live in `api/types/*.go`.

Consider moving a type here when you need to keep backwards compatibility in the API. This legacy types are organized by the latest API version they appear in. For instance, types in the `v1p19` package are valid for API versions below or equal `1.19`. Types in the `v1p20` package are valid for the API version `1.20`, since the versions below that will use the legacy types in `v1p19`.

### Package name conventions

The package name convention is to use `v` as a prefix for the version number and `p`(patch) as a separator. We use this nomenclature due to a few restrictions in the Go package name convention:

1. We cannot use `.` because it's interpreted by the language, think of `v1.20.CallFunction`.
2. We cannot use `_` because golint complains about it. The code is actually valid, but it looks probably more weird: `v1_20.CallFunction`.

For instance, if you want to modify a type that was available in the version `1.21` of the API but it will have different fields in the version `1.22`, you want to create a new package under `api/types/versions/v1p21`.
## Client

The client package implements a fully featured http client to interact with the Docker engine. It's modeled after the requirements of the Docker engine CLI, but it can also serve other purposes.

### Usage

You can use this client package in your applications by creating a new client object. Then use that object to execute operations against the remote server. Follow the example below to see how to list all the containers running in a Docker engine host:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"context"

	"github.com/docker/docker/client"
	"github.com/docker/docker/api/types"
)

func main() {
	defaultHeaders := map[string]string{"User-Agent": "engine-api-cli-1.0"}
	cli, err := client.NewClient("unix:///var/run/docker.sock", "v1.22", nil, defaultHeaders)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	options := types.ContainerListOptions{All: true}
	containers, err := cli.ContainerList(context.Background(), options)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	for _, c := range containers {
		fmt.Println(c.ID)
	}
}
```
##A Sample redis-proxy config and Run

Create an instnace like below using the mrr cli
```
$mrr create -n TestInstance -m 200 -s 2
Attempting to Creating a Redis Instance (TestInstance) with mem=200 slaves=2
Instance Creation accepted..
Check $mrr status -n TestInstance for status
```
Check the status like below
```
$mrr status -n TestInstance
Status = RUNNING
Type = MS
Capacity = 200
Master = 10.11.12.125:6380
        Slave0 = 10.11.12.123:6380
        Slave1 = 10.11.12.123:6381
```

To build the proxy its relatively simple, its a plain go program with no external dependencies.

```
$go build redis_proxy.go
```

It takes a json config file like below FROM ip:port to TO ip:port pair, the below one would actually mean bind to port 6677 the current system and proxy all the tcp to 10.11.12.125:6380 (which is a redis master)

```
$cat TestInstance_proxy.json
	{
			"HTTPPort": "7979",
			"Entries": [{
					"Name": "Master",
					"Pair": {
							"From": "0.0.0.0:6677",
							"To": "10.11.12.125:6380"
					}
			}]
	}

```
Now start the proxy
```
$./redis_proxy --config ./TestInstance_proxy.json
2016/07/06 00:55:03 The config file name is ./TestInstance_proxy.json
2016/07/06 00:55:03 Configuration file is = {7979 [{Master {0.0.0.0:6677 10.11.12.125:6380}}]}
2016/07/06 00:55:03 HandleConnection() {Master {0.0.0.0:6677 10.11.12.125:6380}}
```

Lets try to connec the instance via proxy. Note the redis-server itself is running @ a remote server only the proxy is running @ localhost.
```
redis-cli -h localhost -p 6677
localhost:6677> set foo bar
OK
localhost:6677> get foo
"bar"
localhost:6677> exit
```

if the master dies a new slave is promoted as a master now, lets verify that via mrr cli 

```
$mrr status -n TestInstance
Status = RUNNING
Type = MS
Capacity = 200
Master = 10.11.12.123:6380
        Slave0 = 10.11.12.123:6381
        Slave1 = 10.11.12.125:6380
```

Now lets update the proxy about the new master. get the current configuration of the proxy
```
$curl http://localhost:7979/Get/
Current Config: {
   "Master": {
     "Name": "Master",
     "Pair": {
       "From": "0.0.0.0:6677",
       "To": "10.11.12.125:6380"
     }
   }
 }
```

Update it via http rest as the new master is now at 10.11.12.123:6380

```
$curl http://localhost:7979/Update/ -X "PUT" -d '{"Name":"Master", "Addr":"10.11.12.123:6380"}'
```

re-verify the proxy's config file
```
curl http://localhost:7979/Get/
Current Config: {
   "Master": {
     "Name": "Master",
     "Pair": {
       "From": "0.0.0.0:6677",
       "To": "10.11.12.123:6380"
     }
   }
 }
```

Now re-connect to the same redis-server endpoint and check if the message is available.
```
~/redis_src/redis-stable/src/redis-cli -h localhost -p 6677
localhost:6677> get foo
"bar"
localhost:6677>
```

# Codec

High Performance, Feature-Rich Idiomatic Go codec/encoding library for
binc, msgpack, cbor, json.

Supported Serialization formats are:

  - msgpack: https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack
  - binc:    http://github.com/ugorji/binc
  - cbor:    http://cbor.io http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049
  - json:    http://json.org http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159
  - simple: 

To install:

    go get github.com/ugorji/go/codec

This package understands the `unsafe` tag, to allow using unsafe semantics:

  - When decoding into a struct, you need to read the field name as a string 
    so you can find the struct field it is mapped to.
    Using `unsafe` will bypass the allocation and copying overhead of `[]byte->string` conversion.

To use it, you must pass the `unsafe` tag during install:

```
go install -tags=unsafe github.com/ugorji/go/codec 
```

Online documentation: http://godoc.org/github.com/ugorji/go/codec  
Detailed Usage/How-to Primer: http://ugorji.net/blog/go-codec-primer

The idiomatic Go support is as seen in other encoding packages in
the standard library (ie json, xml, gob, etc).

Rich Feature Set includes:

  - Simple but extremely powerful and feature-rich API
  - Very High Performance.
    Our extensive benchmarks show us outperforming Gob, Json, Bson, etc by 2-4X.
  - Multiple conversions:
    Package coerces types where appropriate 
    e.g. decode an int in the stream into a float, etc.
  - Corner Cases: 
    Overflows, nil maps/slices, nil values in streams are handled correctly
  - Standard field renaming via tags
  - Support for omitting empty fields during an encoding
  - Encoding from any value and decoding into pointer to any value
    (struct, slice, map, primitives, pointers, interface{}, etc)
  - Extensions to support efficient encoding/decoding of any named types
  - Support encoding.(Binary|Text)(M|Unm)arshaler interfaces
  - Decoding without a schema (into a interface{}).
    Includes Options to configure what specific map or slice type to use
    when decoding an encoded list or map into a nil interface{}
  - Encode a struct as an array, and decode struct from an array in the data stream
  - Comprehensive support for anonymous fields
  - Fast (no-reflection) encoding/decoding of common maps and slices
  - Code-generation for faster performance.
  - Support binary (e.g. messagepack, cbor) and text (e.g. json) formats
  - Support indefinite-length formats to enable true streaming 
    (for formats which support it e.g. json, cbor)
  - Support canonical encoding, where a value is ALWAYS encoded as same sequence of bytes.
    This mostly applies to maps, where iteration order is non-deterministic.
  - NIL in data stream decoded as zero value
  - Never silently skip data when decoding.
    User decides whether to return an error or silently skip data when keys or indexes
    in the data stream do not map to fields in the struct.
  - Encode/Decode from/to chan types (for iterative streaming support)
  - Drop-in replacement for encoding/json. `json:` key in struct tag supported.
  - Provides a RPC Server and Client Codec for net/rpc communication protocol.
  - Handle unique idiosynchracies of codecs e.g. 
    - For messagepack, configure how ambiguities in handling raw bytes are resolved 
    - For messagepack, provide rpc server/client codec to support
      msgpack-rpc protocol defined at:
      https://github.com/msgpack-rpc/msgpack-rpc/blob/master/spec.md

## Extension Support

Users can register a function to handle the encoding or decoding of
their custom types.

There are no restrictions on what the custom type can be. Some examples:

    type BisSet   []int
    type BitSet64 uint64
    type UUID     string
    type MyStructWithUnexportedFields struct { a int; b bool; c []int; }
    type GifImage struct { ... }

As an illustration, MyStructWithUnexportedFields would normally be
encoded as an empty map because it has no exported fields, while UUID
would be encoded as a string. However, with extension support, you can
encode any of these however you like.

## RPC

RPC Client and Server Codecs are implemented, so the codecs can be used
with the standard net/rpc package.

## Usage

Typical usage model:

    // create and configure Handle
    var (
      bh codec.BincHandle
      mh codec.MsgpackHandle
      ch codec.CborHandle
    )

    mh.MapType = reflect.TypeOf(map[string]interface{}(nil))

    // configure extensions
    // e.g. for msgpack, define functions and enable Time support for tag 1
    // mh.SetExt(reflect.TypeOf(time.Time{}), 1, myExt)

    // create and use decoder/encoder
    var (
      r io.Reader
      w io.Writer
      b []byte
      h = &bh // or mh to use msgpack
    )

    dec = codec.NewDecoder(r, h)
    dec = codec.NewDecoderBytes(b, h)
    err = dec.Decode(&v)

    enc = codec.NewEncoder(w, h)
    enc = codec.NewEncoderBytes(&b, h)
    err = enc.Encode(v)

    //RPC Server
    go func() {
        for {
            conn, err := listener.Accept()
            rpcCodec := codec.GoRpc.ServerCodec(conn, h)
            //OR rpcCodec := codec.MsgpackSpecRpc.ServerCodec(conn, h)
            rpc.ServeCodec(rpcCodec)
        }
    }()

    //RPC Communication (client side)
    conn, err = net.Dial("tcp", "localhost:5555")
    rpcCodec := codec.GoRpc.ClientCodec(conn, h)
    //OR rpcCodec := codec.MsgpackSpecRpc.ClientCodec(conn, h)

Generate is given a list of *.go files to parse, and an output file (fout),
codecgen will create an output file __file.go__ which
contains `codec.Selfer` implementations for the named types found
in the files parsed.

Using codecgen is very straightforward.

**Download and install the tool**

`go get -u github.com/ugorji/go/codec/codecgen`

**Run the tool on your files**

The command line format is:

`codecgen [options] (-o outfile) (infile ...)`

```sh
% codecgen -?
Usage of codecgen:
  -c="github.com/ugorji/go/codec": codec path
  -o="": out file
  -r=".*": regex for type name to match
  -nr="": regex for type name to exclude
  -rt="": tags for go run
  -t="": build tag to put in file
  -u=false: Use unsafe, e.g. to avoid unnecessary allocation on []byte->string
  -x=false: keep temp file

% codecgen -o values_codecgen.go values.go values2.go moretypedefs.go
```

Please see the [blog article](http://ugorji.net/blog/go-codecgen)
for more information on how to use the tool.

# etcd/client

etcd/client is the Go client library for etcd.

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/coreos/etcd/client?status.png)](https://godoc.org/github.com/coreos/etcd/client)

## Install

```bash
go get github.com/coreos/etcd/client
```

## Usage

```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"time"

	"github.com/coreos/etcd/Godeps/_workspace/src/golang.org/x/net/context"
	"github.com/coreos/etcd/client"
)

func main() {
	cfg := client.Config{
		Endpoints:               []string{"http://127.0.0.1:2379"},
		Transport:               client.DefaultTransport,
		// set timeout per request to fail fast when the target endpoint is unavailable
		HeaderTimeoutPerRequest: time.Second,
	}
	c, err := client.New(cfg)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	kapi := client.NewKeysAPI(c)
	// set "/foo" key with "bar" value
	log.Print("Setting '/foo' key with 'bar' value")
	resp, err := kapi.Set(context.Background(), "/foo", "bar", nil)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	} else {
		// print common key info
		log.Printf("Set is done. Metadata is %q\n", resp)
	}
	// get "/foo" key's value
	log.Print("Getting '/foo' key value")
	resp, err = kapi.Get(context.Background(), "/foo", nil)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	} else {
		// print common key info
		log.Printf("Get is done. Metadata is %q\n", resp)
		// print value
		log.Printf("%q key has %q value\n", resp.Node.Key, resp.Node.Value)
	}
}
```

## Error Handling

etcd client might return three types of errors.

- context error

Each API call has its first parameter as `context`. A context can be canceled or have an attached deadline. If the context is canceled or reaches its deadline, the responding context error will be returned no matter what internal errors the API call has already encountered.

- cluster error

Each API call tries to send request to the cluster endpoints one by one until it successfully gets a response. If a requests to an endpoint fails, due to exceeding per request timeout or connection issues, the error will be added into a list of errors. If all possible endpoints fail, a cluster error that includes all encountered errors will be returned.

- response error

If the response gets from the cluster is invalid, a plain string error will be returned. For example, it might be a invalid JSON error.

Here is the example code to handle client errors:

```go
cfg := client.Config{Endpoints: []string{"http://etcd1:2379","http://etcd2:2379","http://etcd3:2379"}}
c, err := client.New(cfg)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}

kapi := client.NewKeysAPI(c)
resp, err := kapi.Set(ctx, "test", "bar", nil)
if err != nil {
	if err == context.Canceled {
		// ctx is canceled by another routine
	} else if err == context.DeadlineExceeded {
		// ctx is attached with a deadline and it exceeded
	} else if cerr, ok := err.(*client.ClusterError); ok {
		// process (cerr.Errors)
	} else {
		// bad cluster endpoints, which are not etcd servers
	}
}
```


## Caveat

1. etcd/client prefers to use the same endpoint as long as the endpoint continues to work well. This saves socket resources, and improves efficiency for both client and server side. This preference doesn't remove consistency from the data consumed by the client because data replicated to each etcd member has already passed through the consensus process.

2. etcd/client does round-robin rotation on other available endpoints if the preferred endpoint isn't functioning properly. For example, if the member that etcd/client connects to is hard killed, etcd/client will fail on the first attempt with the killed member, and succeed on the second attempt with another member. If it fails to talk to all available endpoints, it will return all errors happened.

3. Default etcd/client cannot handle the case that the remote server is SIGSTOPed now. TCP keepalive mechanism doesn't help in this scenario because operating system may still send TCP keep-alive packets. Over time we'd like to improve this functionality, but solving this issue isn't high priority because a real-life case in which a server is stopped, but the connection is kept alive, hasn't been brought to our attention.

4. etcd/client cannot detect whether the member in use is healthy when doing read requests. If the member is isolated from the cluster, etcd/client may retrieve outdated data. As a workaround, users could monitor experimental /health endpoint for member healthy information. We are improving it at [#3265](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/issues/3265).

session
==============

session is a Go session manager. It can use many session providers. Just like the `database/sql` and `database/sql/driver`.

## How to install?

	go get github.com/astaxie/beego/session


## What providers are supported?

As of now this session manager support memory, file, Redis and MySQL.


## How to use it?

First you must import it

	import (
		"github.com/astaxie/beego/session"
	)

Then in you web app init the global session manager
	
	var globalSessions *session.Manager

* Use **memory** as provider:

		func init() {
			globalSessions, _ = session.NewManager("memory", `{"cookieName":"gosessionid","gclifetime":3600}`)
			go globalSessions.GC()
		}

* Use **file** as provider, the last param is the path where you want file to be stored:

		func init() {
			globalSessions, _ = session.NewManager("file",`{"cookieName":"gosessionid","gclifetime":3600,"ProviderConfig":"./tmp"}`)
			go globalSessions.GC()
		}

* Use **Redis** as provider, the last param is the Redis conn address,poolsize,password:

		func init() {
			globalSessions, _ = session.NewManager("redis", `{"cookieName":"gosessionid","gclifetime":3600,"ProviderConfig":"127.0.0.1:6379,100,astaxie"}`)
			go globalSessions.GC()
		}
		
* Use **MySQL** as provider, the last param is the DSN, learn more from [mysql](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#dsn-data-source-name):

		func init() {
			globalSessions, _ = session.NewManager(
				"mysql", `{"cookieName":"gosessionid","gclifetime":3600,"ProviderConfig":"username:password@protocol(address)/dbname?param=value"}`)
			go globalSessions.GC()
		}

* Use **Cookie** as provider:

		func init() {
			globalSessions, _ = session.NewManager(
				"cookie", `{"cookieName":"gosessionid","enableSetCookie":false,"gclifetime":3600,"ProviderConfig":"{\"cookieName\":\"gosessionid\",\"securityKey\":\"beegocookiehashkey\"}"}`)
			go globalSessions.GC()
		}


Finally in the handlerfunc you can use it like this

	func login(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		sess := globalSessions.SessionStart(w, r)
		defer sess.SessionRelease(w)
		username := sess.Get("username")
		fmt.Println(username)
		if r.Method == "GET" {
			t, _ := template.ParseFiles("login.gtpl")
			t.Execute(w, nil)
		} else {
			fmt.Println("username:", r.Form["username"])
			sess.Set("username", r.Form["username"])
			fmt.Println("password:", r.Form["password"])
		}
	}


## How to write own provider?

When you develop a web app, maybe you want to write own provider because you must meet the requirements.

Writing a provider is easy. You only need to define two struct types 
(Session and Provider), which satisfy the interface definition. 
Maybe you will find the **memory** provider is a good example.

	type SessionStore interface {
		Set(key, value interface{}) error     //set session value
		Get(key interface{}) interface{}      //get session value
		Delete(key interface{}) error         //delete session value
		SessionID() string                    //back current sessionID
		SessionRelease(w http.ResponseWriter) // release the resource & save data to provider & return the data
		Flush() error                         //delete all data
	}
	
	type Provider interface {
		SessionInit(gclifetime int64, config string) error
		SessionRead(sid string) (SessionStore, error)
		SessionExist(sid string) bool
		SessionRegenerate(oldsid, sid string) (SessionStore, error)
		SessionDestroy(sid string) error
		SessionAll() int //get all active session
		SessionGC()
	}

# httplib
httplib is an libs help you to curl remote url.

# How to use?

## GET
you can use Get to crawl data.

	import "github.com/astaxie/beego/httplib"
	
	str, err := httplib.Get("http://beego.me/").String()
	if err != nil {
        	// error
	}
	fmt.Println(str)
	
## POST
POST data to remote url

	req := httplib.Post("http://beego.me/")
	req.Param("username","astaxie")
	req.Param("password","123456")
	str, err := req.String()
	if err != nil {
        	// error
	}
	fmt.Println(str)

## Set timeout

The default timeout is `60` seconds, function prototype:

	SetTimeout(connectTimeout, readWriteTimeout time.Duration)

Exmaple:

	// GET
	httplib.Get("http://beego.me/").SetTimeout(100 * time.Second, 30 * time.Second)
	
	// POST
	httplib.Post("http://beego.me/").SetTimeout(100 * time.Second, 30 * time.Second)


## Debug

If you want to debug the request info, set the debug on

	httplib.Get("http://beego.me/").Debug(true)
	
## Set HTTP Basic Auth

	str, err := Get("http://beego.me/").SetBasicAuth("user", "passwd").String()
	if err != nil {
        	// error
	}
	fmt.Println(str)
	
## Set HTTPS

If request url is https, You can set the client support TSL:

	httplib.SetTLSClientConfig(&tls.Config{InsecureSkipVerify: true})
	
More info about the `tls.Config` please visit http://golang.org/pkg/crypto/tls/#Config	

## Set HTTP Version

some servers need to specify the protocol version of HTTP

	httplib.Get("http://beego.me/").SetProtocolVersion("HTTP/1.1")
	
## Set Cookie

some http request need setcookie. So set it like this:

	cookie := &http.Cookie{}
	cookie.Name = "username"
	cookie.Value  = "astaxie"
	httplib.Get("http://beego.me/").SetCookie(cookie)

## Upload file

httplib support mutil file upload, use `req.PostFile()`

	req := httplib.Post("http://beego.me/")
	req.Param("username","astaxie")
	req.PostFile("uploadfile1", "httplib.pdf")
	str, err := req.String()
	if err != nil {
        	// error
	}
	fmt.Println(str)

# beego orm

[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/astaxie/beego/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/astaxie/beego/latest)

A powerful orm framework for go.

It is heavily influenced by Django ORM, SQLAlchemy.

**Support Database:**

* MySQL: [github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql)
* PostgreSQL: [github.com/lib/pq](https://github.com/lib/pq)
* Sqlite3: [github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3)

Passed all test, but need more feedback.

**Features:**

* full go type support
* easy for usage, simple CRUD operation
* auto join with relation table
* cross DataBase compatible query
* Raw SQL query / mapper without orm model
* full test keep stable and strong

more features please read the docs

**Install:**

	go get github.com/astaxie/beego/orm

## Changelog

* 2013-08-19: support table auto create
* 2013-08-13: update test for database types
* 2013-08-13: go type support, such as int8, uint8, byte, rune
* 2013-08-13: date / datetime timezone support very well

## Quick Start

#### Simple Usage

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/astaxie/beego/orm"
	_ "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql" // import your used driver
)

// Model Struct
type User struct {
	Id   int    `orm:"auto"`
	Name string `orm:"size(100)"`
}

func init() {
	// register model
	orm.RegisterModel(new(User))

	// set default database
	orm.RegisterDataBase("default", "mysql", "root:root@/my_db?charset=utf8", 30)
}

func main() {
	o := orm.NewOrm()

	user := User{Name: "slene"}

	// insert
	id, err := o.Insert(&user)

	// update
	user.Name = "astaxie"
	num, err := o.Update(&user)

	// read one
	u := User{Id: user.Id}
	err = o.Read(&u)

	// delete
	num, err = o.Delete(&u)	
}
```

#### Next with relation

```go
type Post struct {
	Id    int    `orm:"auto"`
	Title string `orm:"size(100)"`
	User  *User  `orm:"rel(fk)"`
}

var posts []*Post
qs := o.QueryTable("post")
num, err := qs.Filter("User__Name", "slene").All(&posts)
```

#### Use Raw sql

If you don't like ORM，use Raw SQL to query / mapping without ORM setting

```go
var maps []Params
num, err := o.Raw("SELECT id FROM user WHERE name = ?", "slene").Values(&maps)
if num > 0 {
	fmt.Println(maps[0]["id"])
}
```

#### Transaction

```go
o.Begin()
...
user := User{Name: "slene"}
id, err := o.Insert(&user)
if err == nil {
	o.Commit()
} else {
	o.Rollback()
}

```

#### Debug Log Queries

In development env, you can simple use

```go
func main() {
	orm.Debug = true
...
```

enable log queries.

output include all queries, such as exec / prepare / transaction.

like this:

```go
[ORM] - 2013-08-09 13:18:16 - [Queries/default] - [    db.Exec /     0.4ms] - [INSERT INTO `user` (`name`) VALUES (?)] - `slene`
...
```

note: not recommend use this in product env.

## cache
cache is a Go cache manager. It can use many cache adapters. The repo is inspired by `database/sql` .


## How to install?

	go get github.com/astaxie/beego/cache


## What adapters are supported?

As of now this cache support memory, Memcache and Redis.


## How to use it?

First you must import it

	import (
		"github.com/astaxie/beego/cache"
	)

Then init a Cache (example with memory adapter)

	bm, err := cache.NewCache("memory", `{"interval":60}`)	

Use it like this:	
	
	bm.Put("astaxie", 1, 10)
	bm.Get("astaxie")
	bm.IsExist("astaxie")
	bm.Delete("astaxie")


## Memory adapter

Configure memory adapter like this:

	{"interval":60}

interval means the gc time. The cache will check at each time interval, whether item has expired.


## Memcache adapter

Memcache adapter use the vitess's [Memcache](http://code.google.com/p/vitess/go/memcache) client.

Configure like this:

	{"conn":"127.0.0.1:11211"}


## Redis adapter

Redis adapter use the [redigo](http://github.com/garyburd/redigo/redis) client.

Configure like this:

	{"conn":":6039"}
# Captcha

an example for use captcha

```
package controllers

import (
	"github.com/astaxie/beego"
	"github.com/astaxie/beego/cache"
	"github.com/astaxie/beego/utils/captcha"
)

var cpt *captcha.Captcha

func init() {
	// use beego cache system store the captcha data
	store := cache.NewMemoryCache()
	cpt = captcha.NewWithFilter("/captcha/", store)
}

type MainController struct {
	beego.Controller
}

func (this *MainController) Get() {
	this.TplNames = "index.tpl"
}

func (this *MainController) Post() {
	this.TplNames = "index.tpl"

	this.Data["Success"] = cpt.VerifyReq(this.Ctx.Request)
}
```

template usage

```
{{.Success}}
<form action="/" method="post">
	{{create_captcha}}
	<input name="captcha" type="text">
</form>
```
glog
====

Leveled execution logs for Go.

This is an efficient pure Go implementation of leveled logs in the
manner of the open source C++ package
	http://code.google.com/p/google-glog

By binding methods to booleans it is possible to use the log package
without paying the expense of evaluating the arguments to the log.
Through the -vmodule flag, the package also provides fine-grained
control over logging at the file level.

The comment from glog.go introduces the ideas:

	Package glog implements logging analogous to the Google-internal
	C++ INFO/ERROR/V setup.  It provides functions Info, Warning,
	Error, Fatal, plus formatting variants such as Infof. It
	also provides V-style logging controlled by the -v and
	-vmodule=file=2 flags.
	
	Basic examples:
	
		glog.Info("Prepare to repel boarders")
	
		glog.Fatalf("Initialization failed: %s", err)
	
	See the documentation for the V function for an explanation
	of these examples:
	
		if glog.V(2) {
			glog.Info("Starting transaction...")
		}
	
		glog.V(2).Infoln("Processed", nItems, "elements")


The repository contains an open source version of the log package
used inside Google. The master copy of the source lives inside
Google, not here. The code in this repo is for export only and is not itself
under development. Feature requests will be ignored.

# Pure Go UUID implementation

This package provides immutable UUID structs and the functions
NewV3, NewV4, NewV5 and Parse() for generating versions 3, 4
and 5 UUIDs as specified in [RFC 4122](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt).

# Mr.Redis - A redis management tool built with AngularJS and Angular Material.


The UI for accessing Mr. Redis server and managing your Redis instances based on 
[Angular Material](https://github.com/angular/material).

# Store
Storage layer of redis framework, this will give MrRedis the ability to remember things permanently.  

There are two types of objects this framework will persist.
* (Redis) Proc
* (Redis) Service Instance


### Redis Proc
A `redis-server` process running in any of the `mesos-slave` is called a **Redis Proc** (Redis Process). 

A Redis **Proc** has the following properties
* In the datacenter each Proc is identified by a UID
* It belongs to a Service Instance
* It binds to a particular port
* It can either be a Redis Master or a Redis Slave
* It has a **PID**
* It is monitored by Redis Monitor **(REDMON)** 
* **REDMON** updates the statistically information about this **PROC** periodically



### Redis Service Instance

A logical representation of the service instance that encapsulates one or more Redis **Proc** 

A Service Instance can be of the following type
* **Single Instance**:	Contains one redis **Proc** exposes an IP/Port
* **Master-Slave**:	Contains one `Proc` as master and rest of the redis `Proc`s as slaves
* **Cluster**: `Future Work when support of Redis 3.0 Cluster is added`

This is identical to **POD** terminology in K8s, we could group one or more **Proc**s as one unit, they are created and monitored together. 

***PS:*** *For convenience we will loose the obvious prefix 'Redis' and simple call `Service Instance` and `Proc` in the rest of the project*

### Considerations

It has been decided to use `etcd` as data store backend initially.  More support of other DB to be added later.

#changes in config file-->
use zookeeper instead of etcd
use dbendpoint as 127.0.0.1:2181 as ip:port
