Static files for testing parsing functionalityCitoid Translators
=============

Scraper.js uses these translators to convert between different types of embedded metadata and the internal Zotero format.

For instance, Schema.org microdata has the type ['WebPage'](http://schema.org/WebPage) where the title of the particlar page is termed 'headline'. In Zotero format (the internal format used by citoid), this would correspond to the type 'webpage' and the property 'title'.

A translator is used to translate from the embedded metadata types and properties to the zotero types and properties to provide the most rich metadata possible.

Each translator here corresponds to a type of metadata found in [html-metadata node library](https://github.com/wikimedia/html-metadata). The name of the file matches the keys found in the Object [metadataFunctions](https://github.com/wikimedia/html-metadata/blob/master/lib/index.js) in the library.

Utility functions that are used across translators are found in ./util.
