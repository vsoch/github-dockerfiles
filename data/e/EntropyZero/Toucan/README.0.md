## Bugs and feature requests

Have a bug or a feature request? Please first read the [issue guidelines](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#using-the-issue-tracker) and search for existing and closed issues. If your problem or idea is not addressed yet, [please open a new issue](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/new).


## Documentation

Bootstrap's documentation, included in this repo in the root directory, is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and publicly hosted on GitHub Pages at <http://getbootstrap.com>. The docs may also be run locally.

### Running documentation locally

1. If necessary, [install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation) (requires v3.0.x).
   **Note for Windows users:** Read [this unofficial guide](http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/) to get Jekyll up and running without problems.
2. Install the Ruby-based syntax highlighter, [Rouge](https://github.com/jneen/rouge), with `gem install rouge`.
3. From the root `/bootstrap` directory, run `jekyll serve` in the command line.
4. Open `http://localhost:9001` in your browser, and voilà.

Learn more about using Jekyll by reading its [documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).

### Documentation for previous releases

Documentation for v2.3.2 has been made available for the time being at <http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/> while folks transition to Bootstrap 3.

[Previous releases](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases) and their documentation are also available for download.

## Versioning

For transparency into our release cycle and in striving to maintain backward compatibility, Bootstrap is maintained under [the Semantic Versioning guidelines](http://semver.org/). Sometimes we screw up, but we'll adhere to those rules whenever possible.

See [the Releases section of our GitHub project](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases) for changelogs for each release version of Bootstrap. Release announcement posts on [the official Bootstrap blog](http://blog.getbootstrap.com) contain summaries of the most noteworthy changes made in each release.

# jQuery

> jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library.

For information on how to get started and how to use jQuery, please see [jQuery's documentation](http://api.jquery.com/).
For source files and issues, please visit the [jQuery repo](https://github.com/jquery/jquery).

## Including jQuery

Below are some of the most common ways to include jQuery.

### Browser

#### Script tag

```html
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.0.min.js"></script>
```

#### Babel

[Babel](http://babeljs.io/) is a next generation JavaScript compiler. One of the features is the ability to use ES6/ES2015 modules now, even though browsers do not yet support this feature natively.

```js
import $ from "jquery";
```

#### Browserify/Webpack

There are several ways to use [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/). For more information on using these tools, please refer to the corresponding project's documention. In the script, including jQuery will usually look like this...

```js
var $ = require("jquery");
```

#### AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition)

AMD is a module format built for the browser. For more information, we recommend [require.js' documentation](http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html).

```js
define(["jquery"], function($) {

});
```

### Node

To include jQuery in [Node](nodejs.org), first install with npm.

```sh
npm install jquery
```

For jQuery to work in Node, a window with a document is required. Since no such window exists natively in Node, one can be mocked by tools such as [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom). This can be useful for testing purposes.

```js
require("jsdom").env("", function(err, window) {
	if (err) {
		console.error(err);
		return;
	}

	var $ = require("jquery")(window);
});
```
[jQuery Validation Plugin](http://jqueryvalidation.org/) - Form validation made easy
================================

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jzaefferer/jquery-validation.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/jzaefferer/jquery-validation)
[![devDependency Status](https://david-dm.org/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/dev-status.svg?theme=shields.io)](https://david-dm.org/jzaefferer/jquery-validation#info=devDependencies)
[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/jzaefferer/jquery-validation](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/jzaefferer/jquery-validation)

The jQuery Validation Plugin provides drop-in validation for your existing forms, while making all kinds of customizations to fit your application really easy.

## [⚠️ Looking for maintainers ⚠️](https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/issues/1569)

This project is looking for one or more maintainers. This mostly involves triaging issues, reviewing pull requests, and occasionally fixing bugs or finishing a feature implementation. If you're interested, [please get in touch](https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/issues/1569).


## Getting Started

### Downloading the prebuilt files

Prebuilt files can be downloaded from http://jqueryvalidation.org/

### Downloading the latest changes

The unreleased development files can be obtained by:

 1. [Downloading](https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/archive/master.zip) or Forking this repository
 2. [Setup the build](CONTRIBUTING.md#build-setup)
 3. Run `grunt` to create the built files in the "dist" directory

### Including it on your page

Include jQuery and the plugin on a page. Then select a form to validate and call the `validate` method.

```html
<form>
	<input required>
</form>
<script src="jquery.js"></script>
<script src="jquery.validate.js"></script>
<script>
$("form").validate();
</script>
```

Alternatively include jQuery and the plugin via requirejs in your module.

```js
define(["jquery", "jquery.validate"], function( $ ) {
	$("form").validate();
});
```

For more information on how to setup a rules and customizations, [check the documentation](http://jqueryvalidation.org/documentation/).

## Reporting issues and contributing code

See the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

**IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT EMAIL VALIDATION**. As of version 1.12.0 this plugin is using the same regular expression that the [HTML5 specification suggests for browsers to use](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#valid-e-mail-address). We will follow their lead and use the same check. If you think the specification is wrong, please report the issue to them. If you have different requirements, consider [using a custom method](http://jqueryvalidation.org/jQuery.validator.addMethod/).
In case you need to adjust the built-in validation regular expression patterns, please [follow the documentation](http://jqueryvalidation.org/jQuery.validator.methods/).
