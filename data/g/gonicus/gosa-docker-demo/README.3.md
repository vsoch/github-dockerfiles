# Dockerized GOsa Demo

This container can be used to play around with GOsa3. Please use
it in conjunction with `docker-compose up` and [this docker-compse.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gonicus/gosa-docker-demo/master/docker-compose.yml)
file.

## Defaults

If you have started `docker-compose` without any additional
parameters, head over to *http://localhost:8000* to go to
the login page.

Use *admin* as the initial username and *admin* for the
password to log in.

**Please note, that this is not meant to be used in production.**
