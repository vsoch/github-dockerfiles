# Demo

Do you want to see directives in action? Visit http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/!

# Installation

Installation is easy as UI Bootstrap has minimal dependencies - only the AngularJS and Twitter Bootstrap's CSS are required.
Note: Since version 0.13.0, UI Bootstrap depends on [ngAnimate](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngAnimate) for transitions and animations, such as the accordion, carousel, etc. Include `ngAnimate` in the module dependencies for your app in order to enable animation.

#### Install with NPM

```sh
$ npm install angular-ui-bootstrap
```

This will install AngularJS and Bootstrap NPM packages.

#### Install with Bower
```sh
$ bower install angular-bootstrap
```

Note: do not install 'angular-ui-bootstrap'.  A separate repository - [bootstrap-bower](https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap-bower) - hosts the compiled javascript file and bower.json.

#### Install with NuGet
To install AngularJS UI Bootstrap, run the following command in the Package Manager Console

```sh
PM> Install-Package Angular.UI.Bootstrap
```

#### Custom build

Head over to http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/ and hit the *Custom build* button to create your own custom UI Bootstrap build, just the way you like it.

#### Manual download

After downloading dependencies (or better yet, referencing them from your favorite CDN) you need to download build version of this project. All the files and their purposes are described here:
https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap/tree/gh-pages#build-files
Don't worry, if you are not sure which file to take, opt for `ui-bootstrap-tpls-[version].min.js`.

### Adding dependency to your project

When you are done downloading all the dependencies and project files the only remaining part is to add dependencies on the `ui.bootstrap` AngularJS module:

```js
angular.module('myModule', ['ui.bootstrap']);
```

If you're a Browserify or Webpack user, you can do:

```js
var uibs = require('angular-ui-bootstrap');

angular.module('myModule', [uibs]);
```
