This directory contains data used to populate registry data for LTI2 TC and TP.

These metadata are referenced by migrations found in db/migrate.

The 'tc_' and 'tp_' prefix indicate which partner is expected to receive these values.
If there is no prefix, the metadata is expected to be used by both TC and TP.
Use this README file to introduce your application and point to useful places in the API for learning more.
Run "rake doc:app" to generate API documentation for your models, controllers, helpers, and libraries.
