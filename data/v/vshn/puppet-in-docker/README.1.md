### Environment variables

| Name                        | Description                                     | Default value  |
| ----                        | -----------------------------------------       | -------------- |
| AUTOSIGN                    | Puppet CA autosign configuration                | true           |
| CA                          | When "enabled" CA service will be enabled       | disabled       |
| CA_SERVER                   | Puppet CA server to request certificate         | puppetca.local |
| CN                          | CN for certificate request                      | $hostname      |
| HIERA_BASE64                | Base64 encoded Hiera configuration              | -              |
| PUPPETDB_SERVER_URL         | URL to PuppetDB                                 | -              |
| PUPPETSERVER_JRUBYINSTANCES | Number of JRuby instances, set to #cpu + 2      | 2              |
| PUPPET_ENC                  | Configuration for external_nodes                | -              |
| SKIP_CRL_DOWNLOAD           | If set to true, skips download of CRL from CA   | -              |
| USE_LEGACY_CA_API           | If set to true, sets CA API URLs for Puppet 3.8 | -              |
| CA_NAME                     | The CN of the generated Puppet CA certificate   | -              |
| CA_TTL                      | Expire TTL of newly created certs by the CA     | 5y             |


**Support for arbitrary configuration in puppet.conf**:

Use environment variables starting with `PUPPETCONF_` to add configuration values to `puppet.conf`.
They are in this format: `PUPPETCONF_<SECTION>_<KEY>=<VALUE>`.

Example:

```
PUPPETCONF_MASTER_ENVIRONMENT_TIMEOUT=unlimited
```

This will add `enviroment_timeout = unlimited` to `puppet.conf` in the section `[master]`.

### Puppetserver configuration

Default configuration files are saved under `config/` and are copied into the image
during the build process. To overwrite these files and put the own customized
configuration into the image (like the Hiera structure) the best way is to build
a new image. Example:

```
FROM vshn/puppet-puppetserver:latest
COPY hiera.yaml /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/hiera.yaml
```

Other scripts, f.e. a custom ENC provider should also be copied into the image
using this way.

### Puppet4

The main build is for Puppet 5 with PuppetDB 5. If you need Puppet 4 with PuppetDB 5 support, use the `Dockerfile.puppet4` which uses
puppetdb-termini version 4.4.x

Support for older PuppetDB versions and support for Puppet 3.8 has been removed.
