## Introduction

This image contains the MCollective client with the Choria and r10k plugin.
It's mainly useful for example to deploy Puppet code from a CI pipeline.

### MCollective client

There is a Docker Compose file available which helps to set the correct parameters.

For getting a client certificate initially, start the container with `SKIP_CERT_CONFIG`
set to true and use the Choria helper:

```
docker-compose run --rm -e SKIP_CERT_CONFIG=true deployer bash
mco choria request_cert
cat .puppetlabs/etc/puppet/ssl/certs/$MCOLLECTIVE_CERTNAME.pem
cat .puppetlabs/etc/puppet/ssl/certs/ca.pem
cat .puppetlabs/etc/puppet/ssl/private_keys/$MCOLLECTIVE_CERTNAME.pem
```

Put the output of the `cat` into their respective environment variables in `docker-compose.yaml`.

The container is now ready. Example invocation of MCollective r10k:

```
docker-compose run --rm deployer mco r10k deploy <environment>
```

See [voxpupuli/puppet-r10k](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-r10k#mcollective-support) for a
detailed documentation about the r10k plugin.
