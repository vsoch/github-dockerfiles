This is Telephasic, a brand new site template for HTML5 UP. It features a sharp, modern
design inspired by omfg everything, and makes good use of SVGs to ensure stuff looks
nice and crispy on retina displays.

A quick note before you jump in: this template is built VERY different to my other stuff
at H5U. Specifically, the breakpoints are entirely different: rather than just three
device-oriented breakpoints (desktop, tablet, mobile), Telephasic uses six content-oriented
ones. Starting with "n1" (which targets the widest displays), each additional stylesheet
("n2", "n3", and so on) progressively alters the design for narrower and narrower displays
until it hits "n6" (which targets mobile displays). This approach, while a bit more
confusing at first, allows the design to fit a much, much wider range of displays, which is
increasingly important in this age of phones, tablets, "phablets", and hell, probably
"smart watches" at some point down the road. That said, I'm still experimenting with this way
of doing stuff, so feel free to email/tweet me your feedback/questions/complaints/etc.
