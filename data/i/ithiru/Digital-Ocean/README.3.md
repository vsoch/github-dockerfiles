BitTorrent Sync Dockerfile
==========================

This will build a [docker](http://www.docker.io/) image that runs [BitTorrent Sync](http://labs.bittorrent.com/experiments/sync.html).


### Building the Image ###

```
docker build -t btsync .
```


### Running BitTorrent Sync ###

```
docker run -d -p 8888:8888 -p 55555:55555 -v /srv/btsync/:/btsync/ btsync
```

`-d` run in detached mode

`-p` expose container port `[public-port]:[container-port]`
> btsync.conf sets the container ports 8888 as the web ui and 55555 as the listening port

> If you do not explicitly set a public port, a random open port will be used because the ports are exposed in the Dockerfile

`-v` mount a local directory in the container `[host-dir]:[container-dir]`
> btsync.conf should be located in a directory mounted to the container directory `/btsync/`
