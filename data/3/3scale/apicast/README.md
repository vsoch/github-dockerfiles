APIcast is an API gateway built on top of [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/). It is
part of the [Red Hat 3scale API Management
Platform](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/3scale).

## Getting started

`master` branch is **not recommended** for production use. For the latest
release, go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/3scale/apicast/releases)

### Docker

You need to specify an `ACCESS_TOKEN`, that you can get from the 3scale admin
portal, and also your `ADMIN_PORTAL_DOMAIN`. If you are using SaaS, it is
`YOUR_ACCOUNT-admin.3scale.net`.

```shell
docker run --name apicast --rm -p 8080:8080 -e THREESCALE_PORTAL_ENDPOINT=https://ACCESS_TOKEN@ADMIN_PORTAL_DOMAIN quay.io/3scale/apicast:master
```

You can use a JSON configuration file instead:

```shell
docker run --name apicast --rm -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd)/config.json:/opt/app/config.json:ro -e THREESCALE_CONFIG_FILE=/opt/app/config.json quay.io/3scale/apicast:master
```

In this example `config.json` is located in the same directory where the
`docker` command is executed, and it is mounted as a volume at
`/opt/app/config.json`. `:ro` indicates that the volume will be read-only.

The JSON file needs to follow the [schema](schema.json), see an [example
file](examples/configuration/example-config.json) with the fields that are used
by APIcast.

### Openshift

You need to create a secret with your `ACCESS_TOKEN` and your `ADMIN_PORTAL_DOMAIN`:

```shell
oc create secret generic apicast-configuration-url-secret \
   --from-literal=password=https://ACCESS_TOKEN@ADMIN_PORTAL_DOMAIN \
   --type=kubernetes.io/basic-auth
oc new-app -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3scale/apicast/master/openshift/apicast-template.yml
```


## Features

- Performance: it is fast because it's built on top of [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) and uses [LuaJIT](https://luajit.org/).
- Scalability: APIcast is stateless, so it scales horizontally.
- Request transformation: allows to modify the headers, the path and the arguments of a request.
- Rate-limit: can apply limits based on a header, [JWT](https://jwt.io/) claims, the IP of the request and many more.
- Modular and extensible: thanks to the APIcast [policies framework](doc/policies.md).
- Monitoring with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).
- [OpenTracing](https://opentracing.io/) integration with [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/).
- Can be deployed in [Openshift](https://www.openshift.com/).
- Integrates with IDPs like [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org) to provide authentication based on [OIDC](https://openid.net/connect/).


## Development

Using Docker you just need to run:
```shell
make development
```

That will create a Docker container and run bash inside it. The project's source
code will be available in the container and sync'ed with your local `apicast`
directory, so you can edit files in your preferred environment and still be able
to run whatever you need inside the Docker container.

To install the dependencies inside the container run:
```shell
make dependencies
```

To run the unit tests inside the container:
```shell
make busted
```

To run the integration tests inside the container:
```shell
make prove
```

To learn about the other available make targets:
```shell
make help
```

APIcast uses:

- [OpenResty](http://openresty.org/en/): a platform that includes NGINX, LuaJIT and Lua modules.
- [busted](https://github.com/Olivine-Labs/busted): for the unit tests.
- [Test::Nginx](http://search.cpan.org/~agent/Test-Nginx/lib/Test/Nginx/Socket.pm): for the integration tests.
