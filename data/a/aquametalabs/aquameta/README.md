aquameta
========

Aquameta is a web development environment where instead of storing code as flat
files in the file system, everything is stored in PostgreSQL as relational
data, including source code, html, css, javascript, images and other resources,
system configurations, database schema, permissions and more.  It has a
web-based IDE, and can be used to build web applications and much more.  For
more info, see [blog.aquameta.com](http://blog.aquameta.com/), espcially the [introduction](http://blog.aquameta.com/2015/08/28/introducing-aquameta/).

Status
------

Aquameta is in early prototype stages, approaching version 0.2.  Do not use it in a
production, or untrusted environment.

Core Modules
------------

- meta - Writable system catalog for PostgreSQL
- filesystem - A bi-directional file system integration system
- events - Pub/sub data change events API
- www - Maps PostgreSQL permissions and data acccess to the web, as well as allowing resource hosting and a web socket event server
- bundle - A version control system similar to git but for database rows intead of files
- widget - Modular web components that can be reused
- p2p - peer-to-peer communication between Aquameta nodes

Installation
------------

Aquameta can be installed either via Docker, on an Amazon Ubuntu 16.04 EC2 instance, or from source on your local machine.

### Docker

To install via Docker, the easiest way is to just pull down the latest image from Docker Hub:

```
docker pull aquametalabs/aquameta:0.2.0-rc2
```

Alternately, you can clone the Aquameta git repository and build your own Docker image (which takes about 15 minutes):

```
git clone https://github.com/aquametalabs/aquameta.git
cd aquameta/
docker build -t aquametalabs/aquameta .
```

Once you've either pulled or built a Aquameta image, run the container to start it up:

```
docker run -dit -p 80:80 -p 5432:5432 --privileged aquametalabs/aquameta:0.2.0-rc2
```

If you wish to use alternate ports, they can be changed in the `docker run` command.

```
# run the Aquameta webserver on port 8080, and the PostgreSQL server on port 5433
sudo docker run -dit -p 8080:80 -p 5433:5432 --privileged aquametalabs/aquameta:0.2.0-rc2
```

Make a note of the container-id that this command outputs.  You can use it to
restart the container later, if you restart your computer, to get your data back.

Once Aquameta is running, browse to `http://localhost/dev` (or whatever
host/port it is installed on) to access the web-based IDE.  To access the
PostgreSQL database, use `psql -p 5432 aquameta`.

Aquameta uses the "long-running container" pattern instead of exporting volumes
at this time, so if you stop the container, just restart it with `docker
restart {container_id}`.


### Amazon EC2

To install Amazon on Amazon, follow these steps:

1. Create a new EC2 instance, running Ubuntu 16.04
2. ssh into your instance with `ssh -i {your_pem_file.pem} ubuntu@{your_ip}`
3. `git clone https://github.com/aquametalabs/aquameta.git`
4. `sudo mkdir /s`
5. `mv ./aquameta /s/aquameta`
6. `cd /s/aquameta`
7. `./install.sh`

From the installer, follow the instructions.  If prompted for any LOCALE settings, just hit OK.

Once the installer completes, you'll have a instance of Aquameta running.  

### From Source (Advanced)

To install Aquameta from source, follow the steps in the
[install.sh](https://github.com/aquametalabs/aquameta/blob/master/install.sh)
script.  The script is designed to run on an Ubuntu 16.04 server, and will
require some adaptation for different environments.

Getting Started
---------------

Once you have Aquameta running, create a superuser and then you can start building applications.

### Create a Superuser

To setup a user, from a shell prompt, open up a database shell with:

```
$ psql aquameta
psql (9.6.9)
Type "help" for help.

aquameta=# select endpoint.register('your_email@example.com');
```

You'll be sent a confirmation code to the email specified.  Check your email and copy the code.  CHECK YOUR SPAM FOLDER!

Then confirm the user registration and make the user a PostgreSQL superuser:

```
aquameta=# select endpoint.register_confirm('your_email@example.com', '{your confirmation code}');
aquameta=# select endpoint.superuser('your_email@example.com');
```

You now have a superuser.  Browse to http://{your_ip}/login to sign in.

### Starting Development

The primary development interface lives at http://{your_ip}/dev.  From here you can create bundles and edit their contents.  To find out more about how to develop apps in Aquameta, here are the available resources:
