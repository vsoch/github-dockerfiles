# From a debian image you will add the appropriate sources to create a TeamSpeak
# server, that will launch along with your container. It will be deemed valid if
# at least one user can connect to it and engage in a normal discussion 
# (no far-fetched setup), so be sure to create your Dockerfile with the right 
# options. Your program should get the sources when it builds, they cannot be in
# your repository.
#
# You can test it by building and then running the service with: ->
#    docker build --tag ex01 --file Dockerfile .
#    docker run --interactive --tty \
#	            --publish=9987:9987/udp \
#               --publish=10011:10011 \
#               --publish=30033:30033 \
#               --name=teamspeak ex01

### Difference between tcp and udp
# There are two types of Internet Protocol (IP) traffic. They are TCP or 
# Transmission Control Protocol and UDP or User Datagram Protocol. TCP is 
# connection oriented â€“ once a connection is established, data can be sent 
# bidirectional. UDP is a simpler, connectionless Internet protocol. Multiple 
# messages are sent as packets in chunks using UDP.
# 
# UDP is suitable for applications that need fast, efficient transmission, 
# such as games. UDP's stateless nature is also useful for servers that answer 
# small queries from huge numbers of clients.
