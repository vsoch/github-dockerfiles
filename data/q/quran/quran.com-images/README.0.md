these fonts were updated by elmohafez.com team to have a copy in the ascii range
of all the items that are outside the ascii range (in most of the pages, this
was already the case, but these 3 pages were the exception). i put them here
in case anyone needs them, but as long as you're reading from the normal
(arabic) range (which this script does), you don't need these.
