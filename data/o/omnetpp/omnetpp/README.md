OMNeT++
~~~~~~~

OMNeT++ is a public-source, component-based, modular and open-architecture
simulation environment with strong GUI support and an embeddable simulation
kernel. Its primary application area is the simulation of communication
networks, but it has been successfully used in other areas like the simulation
of IT systems, queueing networks, hardware architectures and business processes
as well.

If you installed and successfully compiled the source distribution, the omnetpp
directory on your system should contain the following subdirectories.
(If you installed a precompiled distribution, some of the directories may be missing,
or there might be additional directories, e.g. containing software bundled with OMNeT++.)

The simulation system itself:

  omnetpp/         OMNeT++ root directory
    bin/           OMNeT++ executables (opp_run, nedtool, scavetool, etc.)
    include/       header files for simulation models
    lib/           library files
    images/        icons that can be used in network graphics
    doc/           simulation manual (PDF), readme, license, etc.

The example simulations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The example simulations are designed to demonstrate many of the features of
OMNeT++. We recommend that you try tictoc first, which also has an
accompanying tutorial under doc/.
