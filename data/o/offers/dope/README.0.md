**Notice:** This is the library formerly known as
`github.com/codegangsta/cli` -- Github will automatically redirect requests
to this repository, but we recommend updating your references for clarity.

cli is a simple, fast, and fun package for building command line apps in Go. The
goal is to enable developers to write fast and distributable command line
applications in an expressive way.

## Overview

Command line apps are usually so tiny that there is absolutely no reason why
your code should *not* be self-documenting. Things like generating help text and
parsing command flags/options should not hinder productivity when writing a
command line app.

**This is where cli comes into play.** cli makes command line programming fun,
organized, and expressive!

## Installation

Make sure you have a working Go environment.  Go version 1.2+ is supported.  [See
the install instructions for Go](http://golang.org/doc/install.html).

To install cli, simply run:
```
$ go get github.com/urfave/cli
```

Make sure your `PATH` includes the `$GOPATH/bin` directory so your commands can
be easily used:
```
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
```

### Supported platforms

cli is tested against multiple versions of Go on Linux, and against the latest
released version of Go on OS X and Windows.  For full details, see
[`./.travis.yml`](./.travis.yml) and [`./appveyor.yml`](./appveyor.yml).

### Using the `v2` branch

**Warning**: The `v2` branch is currently unreleased and considered unstable.

There is currently a long-lived branch named `v2` that is intended to land as
the new `master` branch once development there has settled down.  The current
`master` branch (mirrored as `v1`) is being manually merged into `v2` on
an irregular human-based schedule, but generally if one wants to "upgrade" to
`v2` *now* and accept the volatility (read: "awesomeness") that comes along with
that, please use whatever version pinning of your preference, such as via
`gopkg.in`:

```
$ go get gopkg.in/urfave/cli.v2
```

``` go
...
import (
  "gopkg.in/urfave/cli.v2" // imports as package "cli"
)
...
```

### Pinning to the `v1` releases

Similarly to the section above describing use of the `v2` branch, if one wants
to avoid any unexpected compatibility pains once `v2` becomes `master`, then
pinning to `v1` is an acceptable option, e.g.:

```
$ go get gopkg.in/urfave/cli.v1
```

``` go
...
import (
  "gopkg.in/urfave/cli.v1" // imports as package "cli"
)
...
```

This will pull the latest tagged `v1` release (e.g. `v1.18.1` at the time of writing).

## Getting Started

One of the philosophies behind cli is that an API should be playful and full of
discovery. So a cli app can be as little as one line of code in `main()`.

<!-- {
  "args": ["&#45;&#45;help"],
  "output": "A new cli application"
} -->
``` go
package main

import (
  "os"

  "github.com/urfave/cli"
)

func main() {
  cli.NewApp().Run(os.Args)
}
```

This app will run and show help text, but is not very useful. Let's give an
action to execute and some help documentation:

<!-- {
  "output": "boom! I say!"
} -->
``` go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "os"

  "github.com/urfave/cli"
)

func main() {
  app := cli.NewApp()
  app.Name = "boom"
  app.Usage = "make an explosive entrance"
  app.Action = func(c *cli.Context) error {
    fmt.Println("boom! I say!")
    return nil
  }

  app.Run(os.Args)
}
```

Running this already gives you a ton of functionality, plus support for things
like subcommands and flags, which are covered below.

## Examples

Being a programmer can be a lonely job. Thankfully by the power of automation
that is not the case! Let's create a greeter app to fend off our demons of
loneliness!

Start by creating a directory named `greet`, and within it, add a file,
`greet.go` with the following code in it:

<!-- {
  "output": "Hello friend!"
} -->
``` go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "os"

  "github.com/urfave/cli"
)

func main() {
  app := cli.NewApp()
  app.Name = "greet"
  app.Usage = "fight the loneliness!"
  app.Action = func(c *cli.Context) error {
    fmt.Println("Hello friend!")
    return nil
  }

  app.Run(os.Args)
}
```

Install our command to the `$GOPATH/bin` directory:

```
$ go install
```

Finally run our new command:

```
$ greet
Hello friend!
```

cli also generates neat help text:

```
$ greet help
NAME:
    greet - fight the loneliness!

USAGE:
    greet [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]

VERSION:
    0.0.0

COMMANDS:
    help, h  Shows a list of commands or help for one command

GLOBAL OPTIONS
    --version Shows version information
```

### Arguments

You can lookup arguments by calling the `Args` function on `cli.Context`, e.g.:

<!-- {
  "output": "Hello \""
} -->
``` go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "os"

  "github.com/urfave/cli"
)

func main() {
  app := cli.NewApp()

  app.Action = func(c *cli.Context) error {
    fmt.Printf("Hello %q", c.Args().Get(0))
    return nil
  }

  app.Run(os.Args)
}
```

### Flags

Setting and querying flags is simple.

<!-- {
  "output": "Hello Nefertiti"
} -->
``` go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "os"

  "github.com/urfave/cli"
)

func main() {
  app := cli.NewApp()

  app.Flags = []cli.Flag {
    cli.StringFlag{
      Name: "lang",
      Value: "english",
      Usage: "language for the greeting",
    },
  }

  app.Action = func(c *cli.Context) error {
    name := "Nefertiti"
    if c.NArg() > 0 {
      name = c.Args().Get(0)
    }
    if c.String("lang") == "spanish" {
      fmt.Println("Hola", name)
    } else {
      fmt.Println("Hello", name)
    }
    return nil
  }

  app.Run(os.Args)
}
```

You can also set a destination variable for a flag, to which the content will be
scanned.

<!-- {
  "output": "Hello someone"
} -->
``` go
package main

import (
  "os"
  "fmt"

  "github.com/urfave/cli"
)

func main() {
  var language string

  app := cli.NewApp()

  app.Flags = []cli.Flag {
    cli.StringFlag{
      Name:        "lang",
      Value:       "english",
      Usage:       "language for the greeting",
      Destination: &language,
    },
  }

  app.Action = func(c *cli.Context) error {
    name := "someone"
    if c.NArg() > 0 {
      name = c.Args()[0]
    }
    if language == "spanish" {
      fmt.Println("Hola", name)
    } else {
      fmt.Println("Hello", name)
    }
    return nil
  }

  app.Run(os.Args)
}
```

See full list of flags at http://godoc.org/github.com/urfave/cli

#### Placeholder Values

Sometimes it's useful to specify a flag's value within the usage string itself.
Such placeholders are indicated with back quotes.

For example this:

<!-- {
  "args": ["&#45;&#45;help"],
  "output": "&#45;&#45;config FILE, &#45;c FILE"
} -->
```go
package main

import (
  "os"

  "github.com/urfave/cli"
)

func main() {
  app := cli.NewApp()

  app.Flags = []cli.Flag{
    cli.StringFlag{
      Name:  "config, c",
      Usage: "Load configuration from `FILE`",
    },
  }

  app.Run(os.Args)
}
```

Will result in help output like:

```
--config FILE, -c FILE   Load configuration from FILE
```

Note that only the first placeholder is used. Subsequent back-quoted words will
be left as-is.

#### Alternate Names

You can set alternate (or short) names for flags by providing a comma-delimited
list for the `Name`. e.g.

<!-- {
  "args": ["&#45;&#45;help"],
  "output": "&#45;&#45;lang value, &#45;l value.*language for the greeting.*default: \"english\""
} -->
``` go
package main

import (
  "os"

  "github.com/urfave/cli"
)

func main() {
  app := cli.NewApp()

  app.Flags = []cli.Flag {
    cli.StringFlag{
      Name: "lang, l",
      Value: "english",
      Usage: "language for the greeting",
    },
  }

  app.Run(os.Args)
}
```

That flag can then be set with `--lang spanish` or `-l spanish`. Note that
giving two different forms of the same flag in the same command invocation is an
error.

#### Ordering

Flags for the application and commands are shown in the order they are defined.
However, it's possible to sort them from outside this library by using `FlagsByName`
with `sort`.

For example this:

<!-- {
  "args": ["&#45;&#45;help"],
  "output": "Load configuration from FILE\n.*Language for the greeting.*"
} -->
``` go
package main

import (
  "os"
  "sort"

  "github.com/urfave/cli"
)

func main() {
  app := cli.NewApp()

  app.Flags = []cli.Flag {
    cli.StringFlag{
      Name: "lang, l",
      Value: "english",
      Usage: "Language for the greeting",
    },
    cli.StringFlag{
      Name: "config, c",
      Usage: "Load configuration from `FILE`",
    },
  }

  sort.Sort(cli.FlagsByName(app.Flags))

  app.Run(os.Args)
}
```

Will result in help output like:

```
--config FILE, -c FILE  Load configuration from FILE
--lang value, -l value  Language for the greeting (default: "english")
```

#### Values from the Environment

You can also have the default value set from the environment via `EnvVar`.  e.g.

<!-- {
  "args": ["&#45;&#45;help"],
  "output": "language for the greeting.*APP_LANG"
} -->
``` go
package main

import (
  "os"

  "github.com/urfave/cli"
)

func main() {
  app := cli.NewApp()

  app.Flags = []cli.Flag {
    cli.StringFlag{
      Name: "lang, l",
      Value: "english",
      Usage: "language for the greeting",
      EnvVar: "APP_LANG",
    },
  }

  app.Run(os.Args)
}
```

The `EnvVar` may also be given as a comma-delimited "cascade", where the first
environment variable that resolves is used as the default.

<!-- {
  "args": ["&#45;&#45;help"],
  "output": "language for the greeting.*LEGACY_COMPAT_LANG.*APP_LANG.*LANG"
} -->
``` go
package main

import (
  "os"

  "github.com/urfave/cli"
)

func main() {
  app := cli.NewApp()

  app.Flags = []cli.Flag {
    cli.StringFlag{
      Name: "lang, l",
      Value: "english",
      Usage: "language for the greeting",
      EnvVar: "LEGACY_COMPAT_LANG,APP_LANG,LANG",
    },
  }

  app.Run(os.Args)
}
```

#### Values from alternate input sources (YAML, TOML, and others)

There is a separate package altsrc that adds support for getting flag values
from other file input sources.

Currently supported input source formats:
* YAML
* TOML

In order to get values for a flag from an alternate input source the following
code would be added to wrap an existing cli.Flag like below:

``` go
  altsrc.NewIntFlag(cli.IntFlag{Name: "test"})
```

Initialization must also occur for these flags. Below is an example initializing
getting data from a yaml file below.

``` go
  command.Before = altsrc.InitInputSourceWithContext(command.Flags, NewYamlSourceFromFlagFunc("load"))
```

The code above will use the "load" string as a flag name to get the file name of
a yaml file from the cli.Context.  It will then use that file name to initialize
the yaml input source for any flags that are defined on that command.  As a note
the "load" flag used would also have to be defined on the command flags in order
for this code snipped to work.

Currently only the aboved specified formats are supported but developers can
add support for other input sources by implementing the
altsrc.InputSourceContext for their given sources.

Here is a more complete sample of a command using YAML support:

<!-- {
  "args": ["test-cmd", "&#45;&#45;help"],
  "output": "&#45&#45;test value.*default: 0"
} -->
``` go
package notmain

import (
  "fmt"
  "os"

  "github.com/urfave/cli"
  "github.com/urfave/cli/altsrc"
)

func main() {
  app := cli.NewApp()

  flags := []cli.Flag{
    altsrc.NewIntFlag(cli.IntFlag{Name: "test"}),
    cli.StringFlag{Name: "load"},
  }

  app.Action = func(c *cli.Context) error {
    fmt.Println("yaml ist rad")
    return nil
  }

  app.Before = altsrc.InitInputSourceWithContext(flags, altsrc.NewYamlSourceFromFlagFunc("load"))
  app.Flags = flags

  app.Run(os.Args)
}
```

### Subcommands

Subcommands can be defined for a more git-like command line app.

<!-- {
  "args": ["template", "add"],
  "output": "new task template: .+"
} -->
```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "os"

  "github.com/urfave/cli"
)

func main() {
  app := cli.NewApp()

  app.Commands = []cli.Command{
    {
      Name:    "add",
      Aliases: []string{"a"},
      Usage:   "add a task to the list",
      Action:  func(c *cli.Context) error {
        fmt.Println("added task: ", c.Args().First())
        return nil
      },
    },
    {
      Name:    "complete",
      Aliases: []string{"c"},
      Usage:   "complete a task on the list",
      Action:  func(c *cli.Context) error {
        fmt.Println("completed task: ", c.Args().First())
        return nil
      },
    },
    {
      Name:        "template",
      Aliases:     []string{"t"},
      Usage:       "options for task templates",
      Subcommands: []cli.Command{
        {
          Name:  "add",
          Usage: "add a new template",
          Action: func(c *cli.Context) error {
            fmt.Println("new task template: ", c.Args().First())
            return nil
          },
        },
        {
          Name:  "remove",
          Usage: "remove an existing template",
          Action: func(c *cli.Context) error {
            fmt.Println("removed task template: ", c.Args().First())
            return nil
          },
        },
      },
    },
  }

  app.Run(os.Args)
}
```

### Subcommands categories

For additional organization in apps that have many subcommands, you can
associate a category for each command to group them together in the help
output.

E.g.

```go
package main

import (
  "os"

  "github.com/urfave/cli"
)

func main() {
  app := cli.NewApp()

  app.Commands = []cli.Command{
    {
      Name: "noop",
    },
    {
      Name:     "add",
      Category: "template",
    },
    {
      Name:     "remove",
      Category: "template",
    },
  }

  app.Run(os.Args)
}
```

Will include:

```
COMMANDS:
    noop

  Template actions:
    add
    remove
```

### Exit code

Calling `App.Run` will not automatically call `os.Exit`, which means that by
default the exit code will "fall through" to being `0`.  An explicit exit code
may be set by returning a non-nil error that fulfills `cli.ExitCoder`, *or* a
`cli.MultiError` that includes an error that fulfills `cli.ExitCoder`, e.g.:

``` go
package main

import (
  "os"

  "github.com/urfave/cli"
)

func main() {
  app := cli.NewApp()
  app.Flags = []cli.Flag{
    cli.BoolTFlag{
      Name:  "ginger-crouton",
      Usage: "is it in the soup?",
    },
  }
  app.Action = func(ctx *cli.Context) error {
    if !ctx.Bool("ginger-crouton") {
      return cli.NewExitError("it is not in the soup", 86)
    }
    return nil
  }

  app.Run(os.Args)
}
```

### Bash Completion

You can enable completion commands by setting the `EnableBashCompletion`
flag on the `App` object.  By default, this setting will only auto-complete to
show an app's subcommands, but you can write your own completion methods for
the App or its subcommands.

<!-- {
  "args": ["complete", "&#45;&#45;generate&#45;bash&#45;completion"],
  "output": "laundry"
} -->
``` go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "os"

  "github.com/urfave/cli"
)

func main() {
  tasks := []string{"cook", "clean", "laundry", "eat", "sleep", "code"}

  app := cli.NewApp()
  app.EnableBashCompletion = true
  app.Commands = []cli.Command{
    {
      Name:  "complete",
      Aliases: []string{"c"},
      Usage: "complete a task on the list",
      Action: func(c *cli.Context) error {
         fmt.Println("completed task: ", c.Args().First())
         return nil
      },
      BashComplete: func(c *cli.Context) {
        // This will complete if no args are passed
        if c.NArg() > 0 {
          return
        }
        for _, t := range tasks {
          fmt.Println(t)
        }
      },
    },
  }

  app.Run(os.Args)
}
```

#### Enabling

Source the `autocomplete/bash_autocomplete` file in your `.bashrc` file while
setting the `PROG` variable to the name of your program:

`PROG=myprogram source /.../cli/autocomplete/bash_autocomplete`

#### Distribution

Copy `autocomplete/bash_autocomplete` into `/etc/bash_completion.d/` and rename
it to the name of the program you wish to add autocomplete support for (or
automatically install it there if you are distributing a package). Don't forget
to source the file to make it active in the current shell.

```
sudo cp src/bash_autocomplete /etc/bash_completion.d/<myprogram>
source /etc/bash_completion.d/<myprogram>
```

Alternatively, you can just document that users should source the generic
`autocomplete/bash_autocomplete` in their bash configuration with `$PROG` set
to the name of their program (as above).

#### Customization

The default bash completion flag (`--generate-bash-completion`) is defined as
`cli.BashCompletionFlag`, and may be redefined if desired, e.g.:

<!-- {
  "args": ["&#45;&#45;compgen"],
  "output": "wat\nhelp\nh"
} -->
``` go
package main

import (
  "os"

  "github.com/urfave/cli"
)

func main() {
  cli.BashCompletionFlag = cli.BoolFlag{
    Name:   "compgen",
    Hidden: true,
  }

  app := cli.NewApp()
  app.EnableBashCompletion = true
  app.Commands = []cli.Command{
    {
      Name: "wat",
    },
  }
  app.Run(os.Args)
}
```

### Generated Help Text

The default help flag (`-h/--help`) is defined as `cli.HelpFlag` and is checked
by the cli internals in order to print generated help text for the app, command,
or subcommand, and break execution.

#### Customization

All of the help text generation may be customized, and at multiple levels.  The
templates are exposed as variables `AppHelpTemplate`, `CommandHelpTemplate`, and
`SubcommandHelpTemplate` which may be reassigned or augmented, and full override
is possible by assigning a compatible func to the `cli.HelpPrinter` variable,
e.g.:

<!-- {
  "output": "Ha HA.  I pwnd the help!!1"
} -->
``` go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "io"
  "os"

  "github.com/urfave/cli"
)

func main() {
  // EXAMPLE: Append to an existing template
  cli.AppHelpTemplate = fmt.Sprintf(`%s

WEBSITE: http://awesometown.example.com

SUPPORT: support@awesometown.example.com

`, cli.AppHelpTemplate)

  // EXAMPLE: Override a template
  cli.AppHelpTemplate = `NAME:
   {{.Name}} - {{.Usage}}
USAGE:
   {{.HelpName}} {{if .VisibleFlags}}[global options]{{end}}{{if .Commands}} command
[command options]{{end}} {{if
.ArgsUsage}}{{.ArgsUsage}}{{else}}[arguments...]{{end}}
   {{if len .Authors}}
AUTHOR(S):
   {{range .Authors}}{{ . }}{{end}}
   {{end}}{{if .Commands}}
COMMANDS:
{{range .Commands}}{{if not .HideHelp}}   {{join .Names ", "}}{{ "\t"
}}{{.Usage}}{{ "\n" }}{{end}}{{end}}{{end}}{{if .VisibleFlags}}
GLOBAL OPTIONS:
   {{range .VisibleFlags}}{{.}}
   {{end}}{{end}}{{if .Copyright }}
COPYRIGHT:
   {{.Copyright}}
   {{end}}{{if .Version}}
VERSION:
   {{.Version}}
   {{end}}
`

  // EXAMPLE: Replace the `HelpPrinter` func
  cli.HelpPrinter = func(w io.Writer, templ string, data interface{}) {
    fmt.Println("Ha HA.  I pwnd the help!!1")
  }

  cli.NewApp().Run(os.Args)
}
```

The default flag may be customized to something other than `-h/--help` by
setting `cli.HelpFlag`, e.g.:

<!-- {
  "args": ["&#45;&#45halp"],
  "output": "haaaaalp.*HALP"
} -->
``` go
package main

import (
  "os"

  "github.com/urfave/cli"
)

func main() {
  cli.HelpFlag = cli.BoolFlag{
    Name: "halp, haaaaalp",
    Usage: "HALP",
    EnvVar: "SHOW_HALP,HALPPLZ",
  }

  cli.NewApp().Run(os.Args)
}
```

### Version Flag

The default version flag (`-v/--version`) is defined as `cli.VersionFlag`, which
is checked by the cli internals in order to print the `App.Version` via
`cli.VersionPrinter` and break execution.

#### Customization

The default flag may be customized to something other than `-v/--version` by
setting `cli.VersionFlag`, e.g.:

<!-- {
  "args": ["&#45;&#45print-version"],
  "output": "partay version 19\\.99\\.0"
} -->
``` go
package main

import (
  "os"

  "github.com/urfave/cli"
)

func main() {
  cli.VersionFlag = cli.BoolFlag{
    Name: "print-version, V",
    Usage: "print only the version",
  }

  app := cli.NewApp()
  app.Name = "partay"
  app.Version = "19.99.0"
  app.Run(os.Args)
}
```

Alternatively, the version printer at `cli.VersionPrinter` may be overridden, e.g.:

<!-- {
  "args": ["&#45;&#45version"],
  "output": "version=19\\.99\\.0 revision=fafafaf"
} -->
``` go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "os"

  "github.com/urfave/cli"
)

var (
  Revision = "fafafaf"
)

func main() {
  cli.VersionPrinter = func(c *cli.Context) {
    fmt.Printf("version=%s revision=%s\n", c.App.Version, Revision)
  }

  app := cli.NewApp()
  app.Name = "partay"
  app.Version = "19.99.0"
  app.Run(os.Args)
}
```

## Contribution Guidelines

Feel free to put up a pull request to fix a bug or maybe add a feature. I will
give it a code review and make sure that it does not break backwards
compatibility. If I or any other collaborators agree that it is in line with
the vision of the project, we will work with you to get the code into
a mergeable state and merge it into the master branch.

If you have contributed something significant to the project, we will most
likely add you as a collaborator. As a collaborator you are given the ability
to merge others pull requests. It is very important that new code does not
break existing code, so be careful about what code you do choose to merge.

If you feel like you have contributed to the project but have not yet been
added as a collaborator, we probably forgot to add you, please open an issue.
# go-colorable

Colorable writer for windows.

For example, most of logger packages doesn't show colors on windows. (I know we can do it with ansicon. But I don't want.)
This package is possible to handle escape sequence for ansi color on windows.

## Too Bad!

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattn/go-colorable/gh-pages/bad.png)


## So Good!

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattn/go-colorable/gh-pages/good.png)

## Usage

```go
logrus.SetFormatter(&logrus.TextFormatter{ForceColors: true})
logrus.SetOutput(colorable.NewColorableStdout())

Gotty is a library written in Go that determines and reads termcap database
files to produce an interface for interacting with the capabilities of a
terminal.
See the godoc documentation or the source code for more information about
function usage.
# go-ansiterm

This is a cross platform Ansi Terminal Emulation library.  It reads a stream of Ansi characters and produces the appropriate function calls.  The results of the function calls are platform dependent.

For example the parser might receive "ESC, [, A" as a stream of three characters.  This is the code for Cursor Up (http://www.vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/CUU).  The parser then calls the cursor up function (CUU()) on an event handler.  The event handler determines what platform specific work must be done to cause the cursor to move up one position.

The parser (parser.go) is a partial implementation of this state machine (http://vt100.net/emu/vt500_parser.png).  There are also two event handler implementations, one for tests (test_event_handler.go) to validate that the expected events are being produced and called, the other is a Windows implementation (winterm/win_event_handler.go).

See parser_test.go for examples exercising the state machine and generating appropriate function calls.

# go-winio

This repository contains utilities for efficiently performing Win32 IO operations in
Go. Currently, this is focused on accessing named pipes and other file handles, and
for using named pipes as a net transport.

This code relies on IO completion ports to avoid blocking IO on system threads, allowing Go
to reuse the thread to schedule another goroutine. This limits support to Windows Vista and
newer operating systems. This is similar to the implementation of network sockets in Go's net
package.

Please see the LICENSE file for licensing information.

Thanks to natefinch for the inspiration for this library. See https://github.com/natefinch/npipe

# go-dockerclient

[![Travis Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fsouza/go-dockerclient.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fsouza/go-dockerclient)
[![AppVeyor Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/4m374pti06ubg2l7?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/fsouza/go-dockerclient)
[![GoDoc](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-Godoc-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](https://godoc.org/github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient)

This package presents a client for the Docker remote API. It also provides
support for the extensions in the [Swarm API](https://docs.docker.com/swarm/swarm-api/).
It currently supports the Docker API up to version 1.23.

This package also provides support for docker's network API, which is a simple
passthrough to the libnetwork remote API.  Note that docker's network API is
only available in docker 1.8 and above, and only enabled in docker if
DOCKER_EXPERIMENTAL is defined during the docker build process.

For more details, check the [remote API
documentation](http://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api/).

## Example

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient"
)

func main() {
	endpoint := "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
	client, err := docker.NewClient(endpoint)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	imgs, err := client.ListImages(docker.ListImagesOptions{All: false})
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	for _, img := range imgs {
		fmt.Println("ID: ", img.ID)
		fmt.Println("RepoTags: ", img.RepoTags)
		fmt.Println("Created: ", img.Created)
		fmt.Println("Size: ", img.Size)
		fmt.Println("VirtualSize: ", img.VirtualSize)
		fmt.Println("ParentId: ", img.ParentID)
	}
}
```

## Using with TLS

In order to instantiate the client for a TLS-enabled daemon, you should use
NewTLSClient, passing the endpoint and path for key and certificates as
parameters.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient"
)

func main() {
	endpoint := "tcp://[ip]:[port]"
	path := os.Getenv("DOCKER_CERT_PATH")
	ca := fmt.Sprintf("%s/ca.pem", path)
	cert := fmt.Sprintf("%s/cert.pem", path)
	key := fmt.Sprintf("%s/key.pem", path)
	client, _ := docker.NewTLSClient(endpoint, cert, key, ca)
	// use client
}
```

If using [docker-machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/), or another
application that exports environment variables `DOCKER_HOST`,
`DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY`, `DOCKER_CERT_PATH`, you can use NewClientFromEnv.


```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/fsouza/go-dockerclient"
)

func main() {
	client, _ := docker.NewClientFromEnv()
	// use client
}
```

See the documentation for more details.

## Developing

All development commands can be seen in the [Makefile](Makefile).

Commited code must pass:

* [golint](https://github.com/golang/lint) (with some exceptions, see the Makefile).
* [go vet](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/vet)
* [gofmt](https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt)
* [go test](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Test_packages)

Running `make test` will check all of these. If your editor does not
automatically call ``gofmt -s``, `make fmt` will format all go files in this
repository.
# go-homedir

This is a Go library for detecting the user's home directory without
the use of cgo, so the library can be used in cross-compilation environments.

Usage is incredibly simple, just call `homedir.Dir()` to get the home directory
for a user, and `homedir.Expand()` to expand the `~` in a path to the home
directory.

**Why not just use `os/user`?** The built-in `os/user` package requires
cgo on Darwin systems. This means that any Go code that uses that package
cannot cross compile. But 99% of the time the use for `os/user` is just to
retrieve the home directory, which we can do for the current user without
cgo. This library does that, enabling cross-compilation.
# Logrus <img src="http://i.imgur.com/hTeVwmJ.png" width="40" height="40" alt=":walrus:" class="emoji" title=":walrus:"/>&nbsp;[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Sirupsen/logrus.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Sirupsen/logrus)&nbsp;[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/Sirupsen/logrus?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/Sirupsen/logrus)

**Seeing weird case-sensitive problems?** See [this
issue](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus/issues/451#issuecomment-264332021).
This change has been reverted. I apologize for causing this. I greatly
underestimated the impact this would have. Logrus strives for stability and
backwards compatibility and failed to provide that.

Logrus is a structured logger for Go (golang), completely API compatible with
the standard library logger. [Godoc][godoc]. **Please note the Logrus API is not
yet stable (pre 1.0). Logrus itself is completely stable and has been used in
many large deployments. The core API is unlikely to change much but please
version control your Logrus to make sure you aren't fetching latest `master` on
every build.**

Nicely color-coded in development (when a TTY is attached, otherwise just
plain text):

![Colored](http://i.imgur.com/PY7qMwd.png)

With `log.SetFormatter(&log.JSONFormatter{})`, for easy parsing by logstash
or Splunk:

```json
{"animal":"walrus","level":"info","msg":"A group of walrus emerges from the
ocean","size":10,"time":"2014-03-10 19:57:38.562264131 -0400 EDT"}

{"level":"warning","msg":"The group's number increased tremendously!",
"number":122,"omg":true,"time":"2014-03-10 19:57:38.562471297 -0400 EDT"}

{"animal":"walrus","level":"info","msg":"A giant walrus appears!",
"size":10,"time":"2014-03-10 19:57:38.562500591 -0400 EDT"}

{"animal":"walrus","level":"info","msg":"Tremendously sized cow enters the ocean.",
"size":9,"time":"2014-03-10 19:57:38.562527896 -0400 EDT"}

{"level":"fatal","msg":"The ice breaks!","number":100,"omg":true,
"time":"2014-03-10 19:57:38.562543128 -0400 EDT"}
```

With the default `log.SetFormatter(&log.TextFormatter{})` when a TTY is not
attached, the output is compatible with the
[logfmt](http://godoc.org/github.com/kr/logfmt) format:

```text
time="2015-03-26T01:27:38-04:00" level=debug msg="Started observing beach" animal=walrus number=8
time="2015-03-26T01:27:38-04:00" level=info msg="A group of walrus emerges from the ocean" animal=walrus size=10
time="2015-03-26T01:27:38-04:00" level=warning msg="The group's number increased tremendously!" number=122 omg=true
time="2015-03-26T01:27:38-04:00" level=debug msg="Temperature changes" temperature=-4

exit status 1
```

#### Example

The simplest way to use Logrus is simply the package-level exported logger:

```go
package main

import (
  log "github.com/Sirupsen/logrus"
)

func main() {
  log.WithFields(log.Fields{
    "animal": "walrus",
  }).Info("A walrus appears")
}
```

Note that it's completely api-compatible with the stdlib logger, so you can
replace your `log` imports everywhere with `log "github.com/Sirupsen/logrus"`
and you'll now have the flexibility of Logrus. You can customize it all you
want:

```go
package main

import (
  "os"
  log "github.com/Sirupsen/logrus"
)

func init() {
  // Log as JSON instead of the default ASCII formatter.
  log.SetFormatter(&log.JSONFormatter{})

  // Output to stdout instead of the default stderr
  // Can be any io.Writer, see below for File example
  log.SetOutput(os.Stdout)

  // Only log the warning severity or above.
  log.SetLevel(log.WarnLevel)
}

func main() {
  log.WithFields(log.Fields{
    "animal": "walrus",
    "size":   10,
  }).Info("A group of walrus emerges from the ocean")

  log.WithFields(log.Fields{
    "omg":    true,
    "number": 122,
  }).Warn("The group's number increased tremendously!")

  log.WithFields(log.Fields{
    "omg":    true,
    "number": 100,
  }).Fatal("The ice breaks!")

  // A common pattern is to re-use fields between logging statements by re-using
  // the logrus.Entry returned from WithFields()
  contextLogger := log.WithFields(log.Fields{
    "common": "this is a common field",
    "other": "I also should be logged always",
  })

  contextLogger.Info("I'll be logged with common and other field")
  contextLogger.Info("Me too")
}
```

For more advanced usage such as logging to multiple locations from the same
application, you can also create an instance of the `logrus` Logger:

```go
package main

import (
  "github.com/Sirupsen/logrus"
)

// Create a new instance of the logger. You can have any number of instances.
var log = logrus.New()

func main() {
  // The API for setting attributes is a little different than the package level
  // exported logger. See Godoc.
  log.Out = os.Stdout

  // You could set this to any `io.Writer` such as a file
  // file, err := os.OpenFile("logrus.log", os.O_CREATE|os.O_WRONLY, 0666)
  // if err == nil {
  //  log.Out = file
  // } else {
  //  log.Info("Failed to log to file, using default stderr")
  // }

  log.WithFields(logrus.Fields{
    "animal": "walrus",
    "size":   10,
  }).Info("A group of walrus emerges from the ocean")
}
```

#### Fields

Logrus encourages careful, structured logging though logging fields instead of
long, unparseable error messages. For example, instead of: `log.Fatalf("Failed
to send event %s to topic %s with key %d")`, you should log the much more
discoverable:

```go
log.WithFields(log.Fields{
  "event": event,
  "topic": topic,
  "key": key,
}).Fatal("Failed to send event")
```

We've found this API forces you to think about logging in a way that produces
much more useful logging messages. We've been in countless situations where just
a single added field to a log statement that was already there would've saved us
hours. The `WithFields` call is optional.

In general, with Logrus using any of the `printf`-family functions should be
seen as a hint you should add a field, however, you can still use the
`printf`-family functions with Logrus.

#### Hooks

You can add hooks for logging levels. For example to send errors to an exception
tracking service on `Error`, `Fatal` and `Panic`, info to StatsD or log to
multiple places simultaneously, e.g. syslog.

Logrus comes with [built-in hooks](hooks/). Add those, or your custom hook, in
`init`:

```go
import (
  log "github.com/Sirupsen/logrus"
  "gopkg.in/gemnasium/logrus-airbrake-hook.v2" // the package is named "aibrake"
  logrus_syslog "github.com/Sirupsen/logrus/hooks/syslog"
  "log/syslog"
)

func init() {

  // Use the Airbrake hook to report errors that have Error severity or above to
  // an exception tracker. You can create custom hooks, see the Hooks section.
  log.AddHook(airbrake.NewHook(123, "xyz", "production"))

  hook, err := logrus_syslog.NewSyslogHook("udp", "localhost:514", syslog.LOG_INFO, "")
  if err != nil {
    log.Error("Unable to connect to local syslog daemon")
  } else {
    log.AddHook(hook)
  }
}
```
Note: Syslog hook also support connecting to local syslog (Ex. "/dev/log" or "/var/run/syslog" or "/var/run/log"). For the detail, please check the [syslog hook README](hooks/syslog/README.md).

#### Level logging

Logrus has six logging levels: Debug, Info, Warning, Error, Fatal and Panic.

```go
log.Debug("Useful debugging information.")
log.Info("Something noteworthy happened!")
log.Warn("You should probably take a look at this.")
log.Error("Something failed but I'm not quitting.")
// Calls os.Exit(1) after logging
log.Fatal("Bye.")
// Calls panic() after logging
log.Panic("I'm bailing.")
```

You can set the logging level on a `Logger`, then it will only log entries with
that severity or anything above it:

```go
// Will log anything that is info or above (warn, error, fatal, panic). Default.
log.SetLevel(log.InfoLevel)
```

It may be useful to set `log.Level = logrus.DebugLevel` in a debug or verbose
environment if your application has that.

#### Entries

Besides the fields added with `WithField` or `WithFields` some fields are
automatically added to all logging events:

1. `time`. The timestamp when the entry was created.
2. `msg`. The logging message passed to `{Info,Warn,Error,Fatal,Panic}` after
   the `AddFields` call. E.g. `Failed to send event.`
3. `level`. The logging level. E.g. `info`.

#### Environments

Logrus has no notion of environment.

If you wish for hooks and formatters to only be used in specific environments,
you should handle that yourself. For example, if your application has a global
variable `Environment`, which is a string representation of the environment you
could do:

```go
import (
  log "github.com/Sirupsen/logrus"
)

init() {
  // do something here to set environment depending on an environment variable
  // or command-line flag
  if Environment == "production" {
    log.SetFormatter(&log.JSONFormatter{})
  } else {
    // The TextFormatter is default, you don't actually have to do this.
    log.SetFormatter(&log.TextFormatter{})
  }
}
```

This configuration is how `logrus` was intended to be used, but JSON in
production is mostly only useful if you do log aggregation with tools like
Splunk or Logstash.

#### Formatters

The built-in logging formatters are:

* `logrus.TextFormatter`. Logs the event in colors if stdout is a tty, otherwise
  without colors.
  * *Note:* to force colored output when there is no TTY, set the `ForceColors`
    field to `true`.  To force no colored output even if there is a TTY  set the
    `DisableColors` field to `true`. For Windows, see
    [github.com/mattn/go-colorable](https://github.com/mattn/go-colorable).
  * All options are listed in the [generated docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/sirupsen/logrus#TextFormatter).
* `logrus.JSONFormatter`. Logs fields as JSON.
  * All options are listed in the [generated docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/sirupsen/logrus#JSONFormatter).

Third party logging formatters:

* [`logstash`](https://github.com/bshuster-repo/logrus-logstash-hook). Logs fields as [Logstash](http://logstash.net) Events.
* [`prefixed`](https://github.com/x-cray/logrus-prefixed-formatter). Displays log entry source along with alternative layout.
* [`zalgo`](https://github.com/aybabtme/logzalgo). Invoking the P͉̫o̳̼̊w̖͈̰͎e̬͔̭͂r͚̼̹̲ ̫͓͉̳͈ō̠͕͖̚f̝͍̠ ͕̲̞͖͑Z̖̫̤̫ͪa͉̬͈̗l͖͎g̳̥o̰̥̅!̣͔̲̻͊̄ ̙̘̦̹̦.

You can define your formatter by implementing the `Formatter` interface,
requiring a `Format` method. `Format` takes an `*Entry`. `entry.Data` is a
`Fields` type (`map[string]interface{}`) with all your fields as well as the
default ones (see Entries section above):

```go
type MyJSONFormatter struct {
}

log.SetFormatter(new(MyJSONFormatter))

func (f *MyJSONFormatter) Format(entry *Entry) ([]byte, error) {
  // Note this doesn't include Time, Level and Message which are available on
  // the Entry. Consult `godoc` on information about those fields or read the
  // source of the official loggers.
  serialized, err := json.Marshal(entry.Data)
    if err != nil {
      return nil, fmt.Errorf("Failed to marshal fields to JSON, %v", err)
    }
  return append(serialized, '\n'), nil
}
```

#### Logger as an `io.Writer`

Logrus can be transformed into an `io.Writer`. That writer is the end of an `io.Pipe` and it is your responsibility to close it.

```go
w := logger.Writer()
defer w.Close()

srv := http.Server{
    // create a stdlib log.Logger that writes to
    // logrus.Logger.
    ErrorLog: log.New(w, "", 0),
}
```

Each line written to that writer will be printed the usual way, using formatters
and hooks. The level for those entries is `info`.

This means that we can override the standard library logger easily:

```
logger := logrus.New()
logger.Formatter = &logrus.JSONFormatter{}

// Use logrus for standard log output
// Note that `log` here references stdlib's log
// Not logrus imported under the name `log`.
log.SetOutput(logger.Writer())
``

#### Rotation

Log rotation is not provided with Logrus. Log rotation should be done by an
external program (like `logrotate(8)`) that can compress and delete old log
entries. It should not be a feature of the application-level logger.

#### Tools

| Tool | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
|[Logrus Mate](https://github.com/gogap/logrus_mate)|Logrus mate is a tool for Logrus to manage loggers, you can initial logger's level, hook and formatter by config file, the logger will generated with different config at different environment.|
|[Logrus Viper Helper](https://github.com/heirko/go-contrib/tree/master/logrusHelper)|An Helper arround Logrus to wrap with spf13/Viper to load configuration with fangs! And to simplify Logrus configuration use some behavior of [Logrus Mate](https://github.com/gogap/logrus_mate). [sample](https://github.com/heirko/iris-contrib/blob/master/middleware/logrus-logger/example) |

#### Testing

Logrus has a built in facility for asserting the presence of log messages. This is implemented through the `test` hook and provides:

* decorators for existing logger (`test.NewLocal` and `test.NewGlobal`) which basically just add the `test` hook
* a test logger (`test.NewNullLogger`) that just records log messages (and does not output any):

```go
logger, hook := NewNullLogger()
logger.Error("Hello error")

assert.Equal(1, len(hook.Entries))
assert.Equal(logrus.ErrorLevel, hook.LastEntry().Level)
assert.Equal("Hello error", hook.LastEntry().Message)

hook.Reset()
assert.Nil(hook.LastEntry())
```

#### Fatal handlers

Logrus can register one or more functions that will be called when any `fatal`
level message is logged. The registered handlers will be executed before
logrus performs a `os.Exit(1)`. This behavior may be helpful if callers need
to gracefully shutdown. Unlike a `panic("Something went wrong...")` call which can be intercepted with a deferred `recover` a call to `os.Exit(1)` can not be intercepted.

```
...
handler := func() {
  // gracefully shutdown something...
}
logrus.RegisterExitHandler(handler)
...
```

#### Thread safety

By default Logger is protected by mutex for concurrent writes, this mutex is invoked when calling hooks and writing logs.
If you are sure such locking is not needed, you can call logger.SetNoLock() to disable the locking.

Situation when locking is not needed includes:

* You have no hooks registered, or hooks calling is already thread-safe.

* Writing to logger.Out is already thread-safe, for example:

  1) logger.Out is protected by locks.

  2) logger.Out is a os.File handler opened with `O_APPEND` flag, and every write is smaller than 4k. (This allow multi-thread/multi-process writing)

Common digest package used across the container ecosystem.

Please see the [godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/opencontainers/go-digest) for more information.

# What is a digest?

A digest is just a hash.

The most common use case for a digest is to create a content
identifier for use in [Content Addressable Storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage)
systems:

```go
id := digest.FromBytes([]byte("my content"))
```

In the example above, the id can be used to uniquely identify 
the byte slice "my content". This allows two disparate applications
to agree on a verifiable identifier without having to trust one
another.

An identifying digest can be verified, as follows:

```go
if id != digest.FromBytes([]byte("my content")) {
  return errors.New("the content has changed!")
}
```

A `Verifier` type can be used to handle cases where an `io.Reader`
makes more sense:

```go
rd := getContent()
verifier := id.Verifier()
io.Copy(verifier, rd)

if !verifier.Verified() {
  return errors.New("the content has changed!")
}
```

Using [Merkle DAGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree), this
can power a rich, safe, content distribution system.

# Usage

While the [godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/opencontainers/go-digest) is
considered the best resource, a few important items need to be called 
out when using this package.

1. Make sure to import the hash implementations into your application
    or the package will panic. You should have something like the 
    following in the main (or other entrypoint) of your application:
   
    ```go
    import (
        _ "crypto/sha256"
   	    _ "crypto/sha512"
    )
    ```
    This may seem inconvenient but it allows you replace the hash 
    implementations with others, such as https://github.com/stevvooe/resumable.
 
2. Even though `digest.Digest` may be assemable as a string, _always_ 
    verify your input with `digest.Parse` or use `Digest.Validate`
    when accepting untrusted input. While there are measures to 
    avoid common problems, this will ensure you have valid digests
    in the rest of your application.

# Stability

The Go API, at this stage, is considered stable, unless otherwise noted.

As always, before using a package export, read the [godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/opencontainers/go-digest).

# Contributing

This package is considered fairly complete. It has been in production
in thousands (millions?) of deployments and is fairly battle-hardened.
New additions will be met with skepticism. If you think there is a 
missing feature, please file a bug clearly describing the problem and 
the alternatives you tried before submitting a PR.

# Reporting security issues

Please DO NOT file a public issue, instead send your report privately to
security@opencontainers.org.

The maintainers take security seriously. If you discover a security issue,
please bring it to their attention right away!

If you are reporting a security issue, do not create an issue or file a pull
request on GitHub. Instead, disclose the issue responsibly by sending an email
to security@opencontainers.org (which is inhabited only by the maintainers of
the various OCI projects).

![Gorilla Logo](http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/static/images/gorilla-icon-64.png)

http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/pkg/mux

Package `gorilla/mux` implements a request router and dispatcher for matching incoming requests to
their respective handler.

The name mux stands for "HTTP request multiplexer". Like the standard `http.ServeMux`, `mux.Router` matches incoming requests against a list of registered routes and calls a handler for the route that matches the URL or other conditions. The main features are:

* It implements the `http.Handler` interface so it is compatible with the standard `http.ServeMux`.
* Requests can be matched based on URL host, path, path prefix, schemes, header and query values, HTTP methods or using custom matchers.
* URL hosts and paths can have variables with an optional regular expression.
* Registered URLs can be built, or "reversed", which helps maintaining references to resources.
* Routes can be used as subrouters: nested routes are only tested if the parent route matches. This is useful to define groups of routes that share common conditions like a host, a path prefix or other repeated attributes. As a bonus, this optimizes request matching.

## Install

With a [correctly configured](https://golang.org/doc/install#testing) Go toolchain:

```sh
go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux
```

## Examples

Let's start registering a couple of URL paths and handlers:

```go
func main() {
	r := mux.NewRouter()
	r.HandleFunc("/", HomeHandler)
	r.HandleFunc("/products", ProductsHandler)
	r.HandleFunc("/articles", ArticlesHandler)
	http.Handle("/", r)
}
```

Here we register three routes mapping URL paths to handlers. This is equivalent to how `http.HandleFunc()` works: if an incoming request URL matches one of the paths, the corresponding handler is called passing (`http.ResponseWriter`, `*http.Request`) as parameters.

Paths can have variables. They are defined using the format `{name}` or `{name:pattern}`. If a regular expression pattern is not defined, the matched variable will be anything until the next slash. For example:

```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
r.HandleFunc("/products/{key}", ProductHandler)
r.HandleFunc("/articles/{category}/", ArticlesCategoryHandler)
r.HandleFunc("/articles/{category}/{id:[0-9]+}", ArticleHandler)
```

The names are used to create a map of route variables which can be retrieved calling `mux.Vars()`:

```go
func ArticlesCategoryHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	vars := mux.Vars(r)
	w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
	fmt.Fprintf(w, "Category: %v\n", vars["category"])
}
```

And this is all you need to know about the basic usage. More advanced options are explained below.

### Matching Routes

Routes can also be restricted to a domain or subdomain. Just define a host pattern to be matched. They can also have variables:

```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
// Only matches if domain is "www.example.com".
r.Host("www.example.com")
// Matches a dynamic subdomain.
r.Host("{subdomain:[a-z]+}.domain.com")
```

There are several other matchers that can be added. To match path prefixes:

```go
r.PathPrefix("/products/")
```

...or HTTP methods:

```go
r.Methods("GET", "POST")
```

...or URL schemes:

```go
r.Schemes("https")
```

...or header values:

```go
r.Headers("X-Requested-With", "XMLHttpRequest")
```

...or query values:

```go
r.Queries("key", "value")
```

...or to use a custom matcher function:

```go
r.MatcherFunc(func(r *http.Request, rm *RouteMatch) bool {
	return r.ProtoMajor == 0
})
```

...and finally, it is possible to combine several matchers in a single route:

```go
r.HandleFunc("/products", ProductsHandler).
  Host("www.example.com").
  Methods("GET").
  Schemes("http")
```

Setting the same matching conditions again and again can be boring, so we have a way to group several routes that share the same requirements. We call it "subrouting".

For example, let's say we have several URLs that should only match when the host is `www.example.com`. Create a route for that host and get a "subrouter" from it:

```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
s := r.Host("www.example.com").Subrouter()
```

Then register routes in the subrouter:

```go
s.HandleFunc("/products/", ProductsHandler)
s.HandleFunc("/products/{key}", ProductHandler)
s.HandleFunc("/articles/{category}/{id:[0-9]+}", ArticleHandler)
```

The three URL paths we registered above will only be tested if the domain is `www.example.com`, because the subrouter is tested first. This is not only convenient, but also optimizes request matching. You can create subrouters combining any attribute matchers accepted by a route.

Subrouters can be used to create domain or path "namespaces": you define subrouters in a central place and then parts of the app can register its paths relatively to a given subrouter.

There's one more thing about subroutes. When a subrouter has a path prefix, the inner routes use it as base for their paths:

```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
s := r.PathPrefix("/products").Subrouter()
// "/products/"
s.HandleFunc("/", ProductsHandler)
// "/products/{key}/"
s.HandleFunc("/{key}/", ProductHandler)
// "/products/{key}/details"
s.HandleFunc("/{key}/details", ProductDetailsHandler)
```

### Listing Routes

Routes on a mux can be listed using the Router.Walk method—useful for generating documentation:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"

    "github.com/gorilla/mux"
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    return
}

func main() {
    r := mux.NewRouter()
    r.HandleFunc("/", handler)
    r.HandleFunc("/products", handler)
    r.HandleFunc("/articles", handler)
    r.HandleFunc("/articles/{id}", handler)
    r.Walk(func(route *mux.Route, router *mux.Router, ancestors []*mux.Route) error {
        t, err := route.GetPathTemplate()
        if err != nil {
            return err
        }
        fmt.Println(t)
        return nil
    })
    http.Handle("/", r)
}
```

### Static Files

Note that the path provided to `PathPrefix()` represents a "wildcard": calling
`PathPrefix("/static/").Handler(...)` means that the handler will be passed any
request that matches "/static/*". This makes it easy to serve static files with mux:

```go
func main() {
	var dir string

	flag.StringVar(&dir, "dir", ".", "the directory to serve files from. Defaults to the current dir")
	flag.Parse()
	r := mux.NewRouter()

	// This will serve files under http://localhost:8000/static/<filename>
	r.PathPrefix("/static/").Handler(http.StripPrefix("/static/", http.FileServer(http.Dir(dir))))

	srv := &http.Server{
		Handler:      r,
		Addr:         "127.0.0.1:8000",
		// Good practice: enforce timeouts for servers you create!
		WriteTimeout: 15 * time.Second,
		ReadTimeout:  15 * time.Second,
	}

	log.Fatal(srv.ListenAndServe())
}
```

### Registered URLs

Now let's see how to build registered URLs.

Routes can be named. All routes that define a name can have their URLs built, or "reversed". We define a name calling `Name()` on a route. For example:

```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
r.HandleFunc("/articles/{category}/{id:[0-9]+}", ArticleHandler).
  Name("article")
```

To build a URL, get the route and call the `URL()` method, passing a sequence of key/value pairs for the route variables. For the previous route, we would do:

```go
url, err := r.Get("article").URL("category", "technology", "id", "42")
```

...and the result will be a `url.URL` with the following path:

```
"/articles/technology/42"
```

This also works for host variables:

```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
r.Host("{subdomain}.domain.com").
  Path("/articles/{category}/{id:[0-9]+}").
  HandlerFunc(ArticleHandler).
  Name("article")

// url.String() will be "http://news.domain.com/articles/technology/42"
url, err := r.Get("article").URL("subdomain", "news",
                                 "category", "technology",
                                 "id", "42")
```

All variables defined in the route are required, and their values must conform to the corresponding patterns. These requirements guarantee that a generated URL will always match a registered route -- the only exception is for explicitly defined "build-only" routes which never match.

Regex support also exists for matching Headers within a route. For example, we could do:

```go
r.HeadersRegexp("Content-Type", "application/(text|json)")
```

...and the route will match both requests with a Content-Type of `application/json` as well as `application/text`

There's also a way to build only the URL host or path for a route: use the methods `URLHost()` or `URLPath()` instead. For the previous route, we would do:

```go
// "http://news.domain.com/"
host, err := r.Get("article").URLHost("subdomain", "news")

// "/articles/technology/42"
path, err := r.Get("article").URLPath("category", "technology", "id", "42")
```

And if you use subrouters, host and path defined separately can be built as well:

```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
s := r.Host("{subdomain}.domain.com").Subrouter()
s.Path("/articles/{category}/{id:[0-9]+}").
  HandlerFunc(ArticleHandler).
  Name("article")

// "http://news.domain.com/articles/technology/42"
url, err := r.Get("article").URL("subdomain", "news",
                                 "category", "technology",
                                 "id", "42")
```

## Full Example

Here's a complete, runnable example of a small `mux` based server:

```go
package main

import (
	"net/http"
	"log"
	"github.com/gorilla/mux"
)

func YourHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	w.Write([]byte("Gorilla!\n"))
}

func main() {
	r := mux.NewRouter()
	// Routes consist of a path and a handler function.
	r.HandleFunc("/", YourHandler)

	// Bind to a port and pass our router in
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8000", r))
}
```

Functions for accessing "clean" Go http.Client values

-------------

The Go standard library contains a default `http.Client` called
`http.DefaultClient`. It is a common idiom in Go code to start with
`http.DefaultClient` and tweak it as necessary, and in fact, this is
encouraged; from the `http` package documentation:

> The Client's Transport typically has internal state (cached TCP connections),
so Clients should be reused instead of created as needed. Clients are safe for
concurrent use by multiple goroutines.

Unfortunately, this is a shared value, and it is not uncommon for libraries to
assume that they are free to modify it at will. With enough dependencies, it
can be very easy to encounter strange problems and race conditions due to
manipulation of this shared value across libraries and goroutines (clients are
safe for concurrent use, but writing values to the client struct itself is not
protected).

Making things worse is the fact that a bare `http.Client` will use a default
`http.Transport` called `http.DefaultTransport`, which is another global value
that behaves the same way. So it is not simply enough to replace
`http.DefaultClient` with `&http.Client{}`.

This repository provides some simple functions to get a "clean" `http.Client`
-- one that uses the same default values as the Go standard library, but
returns a client that does not share any state with other clients.
# Color [![GoDoc](http://img.shields.io/badge/go-documentation-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](http://godoc.org/github.com/fatih/color) [![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/fatih/color.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/fatih/color)



Color lets you use colorized outputs in terms of [ANSI Escape
Codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Colors) in Go (Golang). It
has support for Windows too! The API can be used in several ways, pick one that
suits you.



![Color](http://i.imgur.com/c1JI0lA.png)


## Install

```bash
go get github.com/fatih/color
```

## Examples

### Standard colors

```go
// Print with default helper functions
color.Cyan("Prints text in cyan.")

// A newline will be appended automatically
color.Blue("Prints %s in blue.", "text")

// These are using the default foreground colors
color.Red("We have red")
color.Magenta("And many others ..")

```

### Mix and reuse colors

```go
// Create a new color object
c := color.New(color.FgCyan).Add(color.Underline)
c.Println("Prints cyan text with an underline.")

// Or just add them to New()
d := color.New(color.FgCyan, color.Bold)
d.Printf("This prints bold cyan %s\n", "too!.")

// Mix up foreground and background colors, create new mixes!
red := color.New(color.FgRed)

boldRed := red.Add(color.Bold)
boldRed.Println("This will print text in bold red.")

whiteBackground := red.Add(color.BgWhite)
whiteBackground.Println("Red text with white background.")
```

### Use your own output (io.Writer)

```go
// Use your own io.Writer output
color.New(color.FgBlue).Fprintln(myWriter, "blue color!")

blue := color.New(color.FgBlue)
blue.Fprint(writer, "This will print text in blue.")
```

### Custom print functions (PrintFunc)

```go
// Create a custom print function for convenience
red := color.New(color.FgRed).PrintfFunc()
red("Warning")
red("Error: %s", err)

// Mix up multiple attributes
notice := color.New(color.Bold, color.FgGreen).PrintlnFunc()
notice("Don't forget this...")
```

### Custom fprint functions (FprintFunc)

```go
blue := color.New(FgBlue).FprintfFunc()
blue(myWriter, "important notice: %s", stars)

// Mix up with multiple attributes
success := color.New(color.Bold, color.FgGreen).FprintlnFunc()
success(myWriter, "Don't forget this...")
```

### Insert into noncolor strings (SprintFunc)

```go
// Create SprintXxx functions to mix strings with other non-colorized strings:
yellow := color.New(color.FgYellow).SprintFunc()
red := color.New(color.FgRed).SprintFunc()
fmt.Printf("This is a %s and this is %s.\n", yellow("warning"), red("error"))

info := color.New(color.FgWhite, color.BgGreen).SprintFunc()
fmt.Printf("This %s rocks!\n", info("package"))

// Use helper functions
fmt.Println("This", color.RedString("warning"), "should be not neglected.")
fmt.Printf("%v %v\n", color.GreenString("Info:"), "an important message.")

// Windows supported too! Just don't forget to change the output to color.Output
fmt.Fprintf(color.Output, "Windows support: %s", color.GreenString("PASS"))
```

### Plug into existing code

```go
// Use handy standard colors
color.Set(color.FgYellow)

fmt.Println("Existing text will now be in yellow")
fmt.Printf("This one %s\n", "too")

color.Unset() // Don't forget to unset

// You can mix up parameters
color.Set(color.FgMagenta, color.Bold)
defer color.Unset() // Use it in your function

fmt.Println("All text will now be bold magenta.")
```

### Disable color

There might be a case where you want to disable color output (for example to
pipe the standard output of your app to somewhere else). `Color` has support to
disable colors both globally and for single color definition. For example
suppose you have a CLI app and a `--no-color` bool flag. You can easily disable
the color output with:

```go

var flagNoColor = flag.Bool("no-color", false, "Disable color output")

if *flagNoColor {
	color.NoColor = true // disables colorized output
}
```

It also has support for single color definitions (local). You can
disable/enable color output on the fly:

```go
c := color.New(color.FgCyan)
c.Println("Prints cyan text")

c.DisableColor()
c.Println("This is printed without any color")

c.EnableColor()
c.Println("This prints again cyan...")
```

## Golang logging library

[![godoc](http://img.shields.io/badge/godoc-reference-blue.svg?style=flat)](https://godoc.org/github.com/op/go-logging) [![build](https://img.shields.io/travis/op/go-logging.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/op/go-logging)

Package logging implements a logging infrastructure for Go. Its output format
is customizable and supports different logging backends like syslog, file and
memory. Multiple backends can be utilized with different log levels per backend
and logger.

**_NOTE:_** backwards compatibility promise have been dropped for master. Please
vendor this package or use `gopkg.in/op/go-logging.v1` for previous version. See
[changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for details.

## Example

Let's have a look at an [example](examples/example.go) which demonstrates most
of the features found in this library.

[![Example Output](examples/example.png)](examples/example.go)

```go
package main

import (
	"os"

	"github.com/op/go-logging"
)

var log = logging.MustGetLogger("example")

// Example format string. Everything except the message has a custom color
// which is dependent on the log level. Many fields have a custom output
// formatting too, eg. the time returns the hour down to the milli second.
var format = logging.MustStringFormatter(
	`%{color}%{time:15:04:05.000} %{shortfunc} ▶ %{level:.4s} %{id:03x}%{color:reset} %{message}`,
)

// Password is just an example type implementing the Redactor interface. Any
// time this is logged, the Redacted() function will be called.
type Password string

func (p Password) Redacted() interface{} {
	return logging.Redact(string(p))
}

func main() {
	// For demo purposes, create two backend for os.Stderr.
	backend1 := logging.NewLogBackend(os.Stderr, "", 0)
	backend2 := logging.NewLogBackend(os.Stderr, "", 0)

	// For messages written to backend2 we want to add some additional
	// information to the output, including the used log level and the name of
	// the function.
	backend2Formatter := logging.NewBackendFormatter(backend2, format)

	// Only errors and more severe messages should be sent to backend1
	backend1Leveled := logging.AddModuleLevel(backend1)
	backend1Leveled.SetLevel(logging.ERROR, "")

	// Set the backends to be used.
	logging.SetBackend(backend1Leveled, backend2Formatter)

	log.Debugf("debug %s", Password("secret"))
	log.Info("info")
	log.Notice("notice")
	log.Warning("warning")
	log.Error("err")
	log.Critical("crit")
}
```

### How does this integrate with Docker engine?

This project should provide an implementation to a V2 API for use in the [Docker
core project](https://github.com/docker/docker). The API should be embeddable
and simplify the process of securely pulling and pushing content from `docker`
daemons.

### What are the long term goals of the Distribution project?

The _Distribution_ project has the further long term goal of providing a
secure tool chain for distributing content. The specifications, APIs and tools
should be as useful with Docker as they are without.

Our goal is to design a professional grade and extensible content distribution
system that allow users to:

* Enjoy an efficient, secured and reliable way to store, manage, package and
  exchange content
* Hack/roll their own on top of healthy open-source components
* Implement their own home made solution through good specs, and solid
  extensions mechanism.

## More about Registry 2.0

The new registry implementation provides the following benefits:

- faster push and pull
- new, more efficient implementation
- simplified deployment
- pluggable storage backend
- webhook notifications

For information on upcoming functionality, please see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

### Who needs to deploy a registry?

By default, Docker users pull images from Docker's public registry instance.
[Installing Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) gives users this
ability. Users can also push images to a repository on Docker's public registry,
if they have a [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) account.

For some users and even companies, this default behavior is sufficient. For
others, it is not.

For example, users with their own software products may want to maintain a
registry for private, company images. Also, you may wish to deploy your own
image repository for images used to test or in continuous integration. For these
use cases and others, [deploying your own registry instance](https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/blob/master/registry/deploying.md)
may be the better choice.

### Migration to Registry 2.0

For those who have previously deployed their own registry based on the Registry
1.0 implementation and wish to deploy a Registry 2.0 while retaining images,
data migration is required. A tool to assist with migration efforts has been
created. For more information see [docker/migrator]
(https://github.com/docker/migrator).

# Legacy API type versions

This package includes types for legacy API versions. The stable version of the API types live in `api/types/*.go`.

Consider moving a type here when you need to keep backwards compatibility in the API. This legacy types are organized by the latest API version they appear in. For instance, types in the `v1p19` package are valid for API versions below or equal `1.19`. Types in the `v1p20` package are valid for the API version `1.20`, since the versions below that will use the legacy types in `v1p19`.

## Package name conventions

The package name convention is to use `v` as a prefix for the version number and `p`(patch) as a separator. We use this nomenclature due to a few restrictions in the Go package name convention:

1. We cannot use `.` because it's interpreted by the language, think of `v1.20.CallFunction`.
2. We cannot use `_` because golint complains about it. The code is actually valid, but it looks probably more weird: `v1_20.CallFunction`.

For instance, if you want to modify a type that was available in the version `1.21` of the API but it will have different fields in the version `1.22`, you want to create a new package under `api/types/versions/v1p21`.
This code provides helper functions for dealing with archive files.
