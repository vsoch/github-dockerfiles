Usergrid on Docker
==================

A collection of containers to run [Usergrid](https://usergrid.apache.org) on [Docker](https://www.docker.com).

There are the following containers:

 - Java - Ubuntu base image with Oracle JVM version 8, [github](https://github.com/yep/usergrid-java), [automated build](https://hub.docker.com/r/yep1/usergrid-java), MIT license
 - Cassandra - version 2.1, [github](https://github.com/yep/usergrid-cassandra), [automated build](https://hub.docker.com/r/yep1/usergrid-cassandra/)
 - Elasticsearch - version 1.7, [github](https://github.com/yep/usergrid-elasticsearch), [automated build](https://hub.docker.com/r/yep1/usergrid-elasticsearch/), MIT license
 - Usergrid - version 2.1, [github](https://github.com/yep/usergrid-docker), [automated build](https://hub.docker.com/r/yep1/usergrid)
 - Usergrid Admin Portal - version 2.1, [github](https://github.com/yep/usergrid-portal), [automated build](https://hub.docker.com/r/yep1/usergrid-portal)

To see how the containers can be started, have a look at the `provision.sh` script from the `provision` directory.

Local testing using [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) and deployment to [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](http://aws.amazon.com) are supported, see below.


Run on Vagrant
---------------

To get started quickly, it is recommended to use Vagrant.

Install the following dependencies:

 - [Virtualbox](http://virtualbox.org)
 - [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com)

On windows, you may additionally have to install `rsync` and `ssh` using something like [mingw](http://www.mingw.org) or [cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com).

In the `Vagrantfile`, set the IP for your Vagrant VM. Use an unassigned IP reachable in your local network:

    ip = YOUR_IP

Then, in the root directory of the repository run:

    vagrant up

This should automatically download and start an instance of [CoreOS](http://coreos.com).

Usergrid API should be available on port 8080 and the admin portal at port 80.

Usergrid status at `YOUR_IP:8080/status` should show for cassandra `"cassandraAvailable" : true`, `"cassandraStatus" : "GREEN"` and for elasticsearch `"managementAppIndexStatus" : "YELLOW"`.

If you make any changes to the configuration, update the files inside the VM and restart the containers with

    vagrant rsync && vagrant provision

Using Vagrant, it is simple to start up multiple virtual machines (VMs) simulatenously by changing the `num_instances` parameter in the `Vagrantfile`. You can also adjust the `vb_memory` and `vb_cpu` parameters to change the amount of memory and number of CPUs available to the VM.


Run manually
------------

Instead of using Vagrant, you can use Docker directly. If you are not using Linux on your development machine, it is recommended to install the [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/overview#/docker_toolbox).

The examples below use the automated builds from the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com).

Start Cassandra and Elasticsearch:

    docker run --detach --name cassandra --volume $(pwd)/cassandra-data:/var/lib/cassandra yep1/usergrid-cassandra
    docker run --detach --name elasticsearch --volume $(pwd)/elasticsearch-data:/data yep1/usergrid-elasticsearch

Start Usergrid, configuration is done using environment variables (--env). For a list all configuration variables, see below:

    docker run --detach --name usergrid --env ADMIN_PASS=password --env ORG_NAME=org --env APP_NAME=app --link elasticsearch:elasticsearch --link cassandra:cassandra -p 8080:8080 yep1/usergrid

Start the Usergrid admin portal, change 192.168.1.34:8080 to match the public reachable IP and port of the Usergrid container

    docker run --env USERGRID_HOST=192.168.1.34:8080 -p 80:80 yep1/usergrid-portal


Environment Variables
---------------------

The following [environment variables](http://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockerlinks/#environment-variables) are used to access [backing services](http://12factor.net/backing-services) in scripts in the usergrid container. You have to name the containers of these services accordingly in order that they can be found.

    CASSANDRA_PORT_9160_TCP_ADDR
    CASSANDRA_PORT_9160_TCP_PORT
    ELASTICSEARCH_PORT_9300_TCP_ADDR
    ELASTICSEARCH_PORT_9300_TCP_PORT

Configuration variables for the `usergrid` container:

    ADMIN_USER
    ADMIN_PASS
    ADMIN_MAIL
    ORG_NAME
    APP_NAME
    CASSANDRA_CLUSTER_NAME
    USERGRID_CLUSTER_NAME
    TOMCAT_RAM

Configuration variables for the `cassandra` container:

    CASSANDRA_CLUSTER_NAME
    CASSANDRA_LISTEN_ADDRESS
    CASSANDRA_SEEDS
    CASSANDRA_RPC_ADDRESS
    CASSANDRA_BROADCAST_RPC_ADDRESS

Configuration variables for the `portal` container:

    USERGRID_HOST


Build
-----

Build the containers manually instead of using the automated builds.

Get the submodules first:

    git clone https://github.com/yep/usergrid-docker.git
    cd usergrid-docker
    git submodule update --init

First, build the java base container:

    cd java && build -t usergrid- .

The base container is used by all other containers. In each `Dockerfile` change `FROM yep1/usergrid-java` to `FROM usergrid-java` to use the local java container created above.

Finally, build the containers:

    cd cassandra && build -t usergrid-cassandra .
    cd elasticsearch && build -t usergrid-elasticsearch .
    cd usergrid && build -t usergrid .
    cd portal && build -t usergrid-portal .

Start the containers as shown in section `Usage`, but remove the prefix `yep1/` from the image name to use your local builds.


Run on AWS
----------

Deployment to Amazon Web Services [(AWS)](http://aws.amazon.com) can be done using the `aws-deploy.sh` script from the `provision` directory.

Getting started:

 - Generate key pair in the aws console or add a locally generated key pair
 - Create a user called `usergrid` in IAM, download the credentials and attach the `AmazonSQSFullAccess` policy
 - Start the latest stable CoreOS community ami with hvm (hardware virtualization) of size `m3.medium`. At time of writing, latest is `ami-0e300d13` called `CoreOS-stable-607.0.0-hvm`
 - Set up an SSH alias called `aws` so you can ssh into the machine by typing `ssh aws` without entering a password
 - Run `aws-provision.sh`

Apple push notification (apns) setup note:

When generating the `notifier` in usergrid, a .p12 certificate is required.

To create this .p12 certificate, you have to select BOTH the private key (of type `private key`) and the public key signed by Apple (of type `certificate`) in the Apple keychain OSX app at the same time and then export both of them into one .p12 file.


Usergrid Documentation
----------------------

 * [Usergrid Backend as a Service (BaaS) Documentation](http://apigee.com/docs/api-baas/content/build-apps-home)
 * [Usergrid REST Endpoints](http://apigee.com/docs/app-services/content/rest-endpoints)


Postman
-------

For debugging of REST commands, you can use [Postman](http://getpostman.com).

Import the postman collection `usergrid.json.postman_collection` and environment `usergrid.json.postman_environment` from the `postman` directory.

To use `postman`, request an API token using one of the provided commands and set the `token` parameter in the `environment` of `postman` accordingly. Also set the `ip` parameter in the environment.


Usage
-----

Some useful `vagrant` commands:

 * `vagrant up` - start VM
 * `vagrant ssh` - ssh into VM
 * `vagrant halt` - stop VM
 * `vagrant destroy` - remove VM, run `vagrant up` to start from scratch
 * `vagrant rsync` - update shared folder using rsync
 * `vagrant provision` - run the provion script from the Vagrantfile
 * `vagrant box update` - update CoreOS base box

Some useful `docker` commands, run these from inside of the VM:

 * `docker build -t usergrid .` - build the dockerfile in the current directory and tag the container with `usergrid`
 * `docker run -d --name usergrid --link elasticsearch:elasticsearch --link cassandra:cassandra -t usergrid` - run the container which was built with the above command in the background (detached, -d), expose the usergrid http api port (8080, -p) and make the ports exposed by `elasticsearch` and `cassandra` available by linking the containers together
 * `docker ps` - show container ids of running containers
 * `docker logs -f usergrid` - follow the log of the container with tag `usergrid`
 * `docker stop usergrid` - stop running container with tag `usergrid`
 * `docker run -i -t usergrid /bin/bash` - start an interactive bash shell in the container with tag `usergrid`
 * `docker ps -q|docker stop; docker images -q|xargs docker rmi -f` - stop and delete ALL old docker images to free up disk space

Some useful usergrid command line `ugc` commands:

Install `ugc` with `gem install ugc`. Documentation is [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-usergrid/tree/master/ugc). For more examples, see the [ugc examples](https://github.com/apache/incubator-usergrid/tree/master/ugc#examples).

 * `ugc profile org` - create profile with name `org`. subsequent commands are applied to this profile.
 * `ugc target url http://$IP:8080/org/app` - use host at $IP, organization called `org` and app called `app`
 * `ugc login --admin $USERNAME@example.com` - log in as one of the admins users `admin` or `orgadmin`. password is the same as the username.
 * `ugc login $USERNAME@example.com` - log in as regular user. there is a default user called `orguser`. password is same as username.
 * `ugc list collections` - list collections. think of it as tables in a relational database. you can list other things as well.

Some useful Virtualbox commands:

 * `VBoxManage hostonlyif remove vboxnet0` - manually delete a hostonly network if it was not properly removed by Virtualbox

Some useful OSX commands:

 * `ifconfig bridge0 delete` - manually delete a bridge if it was not properly removed by Virtualbox
