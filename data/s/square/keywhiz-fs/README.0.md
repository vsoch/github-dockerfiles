## Overview

Kingpin is a [fluent-style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface),
type-safe command-line parser. It supports flags, nested commands, and
positional arguments.

Install it with:

    $ go get gopkg.in/alecthomas/kingpin.v2

It looks like this:

```go
var (
  verbose = kingpin.Flag("verbose", "Verbose mode.").Short('v').Bool()
  name    = kingpin.Arg("name", "Name of user.").Required().String()
)

func main() {
  kingpin.Parse()
  fmt.Printf("%v, %s\n", *verbose, *name)
}
```

More [examples](https://github.com/alecthomas/kingpin/tree/master/examples) are available.

Second to parsing, providing the user with useful help is probably the most
important thing a command-line parser does. Kingpin tries to provide detailed
contextual help if `--help` is encountered at any point in the command line
(excluding after `--`).

## Features

- Help output that isn't as ugly as sin.
- Fully [customisable help](#custom-help), via Go templates.
- Parsed, type-safe flags (`kingpin.Flag("f", "help").Int()`)
- Parsed, type-safe positional arguments (`kingpin.Arg("a", "help").Int()`).
- Parsed, type-safe, arbitrarily deep commands (`kingpin.Command("c", "help")`).
- Support for required flags and required positional arguments (`kingpin.Flag("f", "").Required().Int()`).
- Support for arbitrarily nested default commands (`command.Default()`).
- Callbacks per command, flag and argument (`kingpin.Command("c", "").Action(myAction)`).
- POSIX-style short flag combining (`-a -b` -> `-ab`).
- Short-flag+parameter combining (`-a parm` -> `-aparm`).
- Read command-line from files (`@<file>`).
- Automatically generate man pages (`--help-man`).

## User-visible changes between v1 and v2

### Flags can be used at any point after their definition.

Flags can be specified at any point after their definition, not just
*immediately after their associated command*. From the chat example below, the
following used to be required:

```
$ chat --server=chat.server.com:8080 post --image=~/Downloads/owls.jpg pics
```

But the following will now work:

```
$ chat post --server=chat.server.com:8080 --image=~/Downloads/owls.jpg pics
```

### Short flags can be combined with their parameters

Previously, if a short flag was used, any argument to that flag would have to
be separated by a space. That is no longer the case.

## API changes between v1 and v2

- `ParseWithFileExpansion()` is gone. The new parser directly supports expanding `@<file>`.
- Added `FatalUsage()` and `FatalUsageContext()` for displaying an error + usage and terminating.
- `Dispatch()` renamed to `Action()`.
- Added `ParseContext()` for parsing a command line into its intermediate context form without executing.
- Added `Terminate()` function to override the termination function.
- Added `UsageForContextWithTemplate()` for printing usage via a custom template.
- Added `UsageTemplate()` for overriding the default template to use. Two templates are included:
    1. `DefaultUsageTemplate` - default template.
    2. `CompactUsageTemplate` - compact command template for larger applications.

## Versions

Kingpin uses [gopkg.in](https://gopkg.in/alecthomas/kingpin) for versioning.

The current stable version is [gopkg.in/alecthomas/kingpin.v2](https://gopkg.in/alecthomas/kingpin.v2). The previous version, [gopkg.in/alecthomas/kingpin.v1](https://gopkg.in/alecthomas/kingpin.v1), is deprecated and in maintenance mode.

### [V2](https://gopkg.in/alecthomas/kingpin.v2) is the current stable version

Installation:

```sh
$ go get gopkg.in/alecthomas/kingpin.v2
```

### [V1](https://gopkg.in/alecthomas/kingpin.v1) is the OLD stable version

Installation:

```sh
$ go get gopkg.in/alecthomas/kingpin.v1
```

## Change History

- *2015-09-19* -- Stable v2.1.0 release.
    - Added `command.Default()` to specify a default command to use if no other
      command matches. This allows for convenient user shortcuts.
    - Exposed `HelpFlag` and `VersionFlag` for further cusomisation.
    - `Action()` and `PreAction()` added and both now support an arbitrary
      number of callbacks.
    - `kingpin.SeparateOptionalFlagsUsageTemplate`.
    - `--help-long` and `--help-man` (hidden by default) flags.
    - Flags are "interspersed" by default, but can be disabled with `app.Interspersed(false)`.
    - Added flags for all simple builtin types (int8, uint16, etc.) and slice variants.
    - Use `app.Writer(os.Writer)` to specify the default writer for all output functions.
    - Dropped `os.Writer` prefix from all printf-like functions.

- *2015-05-22* -- Stable v2.0.0 release.
    - Initial stable release of v2.0.0.
    - Fully supports interspersed flags, commands and arguments.
    - Flags can be present at any point after their logical definition.
    - Application.Parse() terminates if commands are present and a command is not parsed.
    - Dispatch() -> Action().
    - Actions are dispatched after all values are populated.
    - Override termination function (defaults to os.Exit).
    - Override output stream (defaults to os.Stderr).
    - Templatised usage help, with default and compact templates.
    - Make error/usage functions more consistent.
    - Support argument expansion from files by default (with @<file>).
    - Fully public data model is available via .Model().
    - Parser has been completely refactored.
    - Parsing and execution has been split into distinct stages.
    - Use `go generate` to generate repeated flags.
    - Support combined short-flag+argument: -fARG.

- *2015-01-23* -- Stable v1.3.4 release.
    - Support "--" for separating flags from positional arguments.
    - Support loading flags from files (ParseWithFileExpansion()). Use @FILE as an argument.
    - Add post-app and post-cmd validation hooks. This allows arbitrary validation to be added.
    - A bunch of improvements to help usage and formatting.
    - Support arbitrarily nested sub-commands.

- *2014-07-08* -- Stable v1.2.0 release.
    - Pass any value through to `Strings()` when final argument.
      Allows for values that look like flags to be processed.
    - Allow `--help` to be used with commands.
    - Support `Hidden()` flags.
    - Parser for [units.Base2Bytes](https://github.com/alecthomas/units)
      type. Allows for flags like `--ram=512MB` or `--ram=1GB`.
    - Add an `Enum()` value, allowing only one of a set of values
      to be selected. eg. `Flag(...).Enum("debug", "info", "warning")`.

- *2014-06-27* -- Stable v1.1.0 release.
    - Bug fixes.
    - Always return an error (rather than panicing) when misconfigured.
    - `OpenFile(flag, perm)` value type added, for finer control over opening files.
    - Significantly improved usage formatting.

- *2014-06-19* -- Stable v1.0.0 release.
    - Support [cumulative positional](#consuming-all-remaining-arguments) arguments.
    - Return error rather than panic when there are fatal errors not caught by
      the type system. eg. when a default value is invalid.
    - Use gokpg.in.

- *2014-06-10* -- Place-holder streamlining.
    - Renamed `MetaVar` to `PlaceHolder`.
    - Removed `MetaVarFromDefault`. Kingpin now uses [heuristics](#place-holders-in-help)
      to determine what to display.

## Examples

### Simple Example

Kingpin can be used for simple flag+arg applications like so:

```
$ ping --help
usage: ping [<flags>] <ip> [<count>]

Flags:
  --debug            Enable debug mode.
  --help             Show help.
  -t, --timeout=5s   Timeout waiting for ping.

Args:
  <ip>        IP address to ping.
  [<count>]   Number of packets to send
$ ping 1.2.3.4 5
Would ping: 1.2.3.4 with timeout 5s and count 0
```

From the following source:

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"

  "gopkg.in/alecthomas/kingpin.v2"
)

var (
  debug   = kingpin.Flag("debug", "Enable debug mode.").Bool()
  timeout = kingpin.Flag("timeout", "Timeout waiting for ping.").Default("5s").OverrideDefaultFromEnvar("PING_TIMEOUT").Short('t').Duration()
  ip      = kingpin.Arg("ip", "IP address to ping.").Required().IP()
  count   = kingpin.Arg("count", "Number of packets to send").Int()
)

func main() {
  kingpin.Version("0.0.1")
  kingpin.Parse()
  fmt.Printf("Would ping: %s with timeout %s and count %d", *ip, *timeout, *count)
}
```

### Complex Example

Kingpin can also produce complex command-line applications with global flags,
subcommands, and per-subcommand flags, like this:

```
$ chat --help
usage: chat [<flags>] <command> [<flags>] [<args> ...]

A command-line chat application.

Flags:
  --help              Show help.
  --debug             Enable debug mode.
  --server=127.0.0.1  Server address.

Commands:
  help [<command>]
    Show help for a command.

  register <nick> <name>
    Register a new user.

  post [<flags>] <channel> [<text>]
    Post a message to a channel.

$ chat help post
usage: chat [<flags>] post [<flags>] <channel> [<text>]

Post a message to a channel.

Flags:
  --image=IMAGE  Image to post.

Args:
  <channel>  Channel to post to.
  [<text>]   Text to post.

$ chat post --image=~/Downloads/owls.jpg pics
...
```

From this code:

```go
package main

import (
  "os"
  "strings"
  "gopkg.in/alecthomas/kingpin.v2"
)

var (
  app      = kingpin.New("chat", "A command-line chat application.")
  debug    = app.Flag("debug", "Enable debug mode.").Bool()
  serverIP = app.Flag("server", "Server address.").Default("127.0.0.1").IP()

  register     = app.Command("register", "Register a new user.")
  registerNick = register.Arg("nick", "Nickname for user.").Required().String()
  registerName = register.Arg("name", "Name of user.").Required().String()

  post        = app.Command("post", "Post a message to a channel.")
  postImage   = post.Flag("image", "Image to post.").File()
  postChannel = post.Arg("channel", "Channel to post to.").Required().String()
  postText    = post.Arg("text", "Text to post.").Strings()
)

func main() {
  switch kingpin.MustParse(app.Parse(os.Args[1:])) {
  // Register user
  case register.FullCommand():
    println(*registerNick)

  // Post message
  case post.FullCommand():
    if *postImage != nil {
    }
    text := strings.Join(*postText, " ")
    println("Post:", text)
  }
}
```

## Reference Documentation

### Displaying errors and usage information

Kingpin exports a set of functions to provide consistent errors and usage
information to the user.

Error messages look something like this:

    <app>: error: <message>

The functions on `Application` are:

Function | Purpose
---------|--------------
`Errorf(format, args)` | Display a printf formatted error to the user.
`Fatalf(format, args)` | As with Errorf, but also call the termination handler.
`FatalUsage(format, args)` | As with Fatalf, but also print contextual usage information.
`FatalUsageContext(context, format, args)` | As with Fatalf, but also print contextual usage information from a `ParseContext`.
`FatalIfError(err, format, args)` | Conditionally print an error prefixed with format+args, then call the termination handler

There are equivalent global functions in the kingpin namespace for the default
`kingpin.CommandLine` instance.

### Sub-commands

Kingpin supports nested sub-commands, with separate flag and positional
arguments per sub-command. Note that positional arguments may only occur after
sub-commands.

For example:

```go
var (
  deleteCommand     = kingpin.Command("delete", "Delete an object.")
  deleteUserCommand = deleteCommand.Command("user", "Delete a user.")
  deleteUserUIDFlag = deleteUserCommand.Flag("uid", "Delete user by UID rather than username.")
  deleteUserUsername = deleteUserCommand.Arg("username", "Username to delete.")
  deletePostCommand = deleteCommand.Command("post", "Delete a post.")
)

func main() {
  switch kingpin.Parse() {
  case "delete user":
  case "delete post":
  }
}
```

### Custom Parsers

Kingpin supports both flag and positional argument parsers for converting to
Go types. For example, some included parsers are `Int()`, `Float()`,
`Duration()` and `ExistingFile()`.

Parsers conform to Go's [`flag.Value`](http://godoc.org/flag#Value)
interface, so any existing implementations will work.

For example, a parser for accumulating HTTP header values might look like this:

```go
type HTTPHeaderValue http.Header

func (h *HTTPHeaderValue) Set(value string) error {
  parts := strings.SplitN(value, ":", 2)
  if len(parts) != 2 {
    return fmt.Errorf("expected HEADER:VALUE got '%s'", value)
  }
  (*http.Header)(h).Add(parts[0], parts[1])
  return nil
}

func (h *HTTPHeaderValue) String() string {
  return ""
}
```

As a convenience, I would recommend something like this:

```go
func HTTPHeader(s Settings) (target *http.Header) {
  target = new(http.Header)
  s.SetValue((*HTTPHeaderValue)(target))
  return
}
```

You would use it like so:

```go
headers = HTTPHeader(kingpin.Flag("header", "Add a HTTP header to the request.").Short('H'))
```

### Repeatable flags

Depending on the `Value` they hold, some flags may be repeated. The
`IsCumulative() bool` function on `Value` tells if it's safe to call `Set()`
multiple times or if an error should be raised if several values are passed.

The built-in `Value`s returning slices and maps, as well as `Counter` are
examples of `Value`s that make a flag repeatable.

### Boolean values

Boolean values are uniquely managed by Kingpin. Each boolean flag will have a negative complement:
`--<name>` and `--no-<name>`.

### Default Values

The default value is the zero value for a type. This can be overridden with
the `Default(value...)` function on flags and arguments. This function accepts
one or several strings, which are parsed by the value itself, so they *must*
be compliant with the format expected.

### Place-holders in Help

The place-holder value for a flag is the value used in the help to describe
the value of a non-boolean flag.

The value provided to PlaceHolder() is used if provided, then the value
provided by Default() if provided, then finally the capitalised flag name is
used.

Here are some examples of flags with various permutations:

    --name=NAME           // Flag(...).String()
    --name="Harry"        // Flag(...).Default("Harry").String()
    --name=FULL-NAME      // flag(...).PlaceHolder("FULL-NAME").Default("Harry").String()

### Consuming all remaining arguments

A common command-line idiom is to use all remaining arguments for some
purpose. eg. The following command accepts an arbitrary number of
IP addresses as positional arguments:

    ./cmd ping 10.1.1.1 192.168.1.1

Such arguments are similar to [repeatable flags](#repeatable-flags), but for
arguments. Therefore they use the same `IsCumulative() bool` function on the
underlying `Value`, so the built-in `Value`s for which the `Set()` function
can be called several times will consume multiple arguments.

To implement the above example with a custom `Value`, we might do something
like this:

```go
type ipList []net.IP

func (i *ipList) Set(value string) error {
  if ip := net.ParseIP(value); ip == nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("'%s' is not an IP address", value)
  } else {
    *i = append(*i, ip)
    return nil
  }
}

func (i *ipList) String() string {
  return ""
}

func (i *ipList) IsCumulative() bool {
  return true
}

func IPList(s Settings) (target *[]net.IP) {
  target = new([]net.IP)
  s.SetValue((*ipList)(target))
  return
}
```

And use it like so:

```go
ips := IPList(kingpin.Arg("ips", "IP addresses to ping."))
```

### Bash/ZSH Shell Completion

By default, all flags and commands/subcommands generate completions 
internally.

Out of the box, CLI tools using kingpin should be able to take advantage 
of completion hinting for flags and commands. By specifying 
`--completion-bash` as the first argument, your CLI tool will show 
possible subcommands. By ending your argv with `--`, hints for flags 
will be shown.

To allow your end users to take advantage you must package a 
`/etc/bash_completion.d` script with your distribution (or the equivalent 
for your target platform/shell). An alternative is to instruct your end 
user to source a script from their `bash_profile` (or equivalent).

Fortunately Kingpin makes it easy to generate or source a script for use
with end users shells. `./yourtool --completion-script-bash` and 
`./yourtool --completion-script-zsh` will generate these scripts for you.

**Installation by Package**

For the best user experience, you should bundle your pre-created 
completion script with your CLI tool and install it inside 
`/etc/bash_completion.d` (or equivalent). A good suggestion is to add 
this as an automated step to your build pipeline, in the implementation 
is improved for bug fixed.

**Installation by `bash_profile`**

Alternatively, instruct your users to add an additional statement to 
their `bash_profile` (or equivalent):

```
eval "$(your-cli-tool --completion-script-bash)"
```

Or for ZSH

```
eval "$(your-cli-tool --completion-script-zsh)"
```

#### Additional API
To provide more flexibility, a completion option API has been
exposed for flags to allow user defined completion options, to extend
completions further than just EnumVar/Enum. 


**Provide Static Options**

When using an `Enum` or `EnumVar`, users are limited to only the options 
given. Maybe we wish to hint possible options to the user, but also 
allow them to provide their own custom option. `HintOptions` gives
this functionality to flags.

```
app := kingpin.New("completion", "My application with bash completion.")
app.Flag("port", "Provide a port to connect to").
    Required().
    HintOptions("80", "443", "8080").
    IntVar(&c.port)
```

**Provide Dynamic Options**
Consider the case that you needed to read a local database or a file to 
provide suggestions. You can dynamically generate the options

```
func listHosts(args []string) []string {
  // Provide a dynamic list of hosts from a hosts file or otherwise
  // for bash completion. In this example we simply return static slice.

  // You could use this functionality to reach into a hosts file to provide
  // completion for a list of known hosts.
  return []string{"sshhost.example", "webhost.example", "ftphost.example"}
}

app := kingpin.New("completion", "My application with bash completion.")
app.Flag("flag-1", "").HintAction(listHosts).String()
```

**EnumVar/Enum**
When using `Enum` or `EnumVar`, any provided options will be automatically
used for bash autocompletion. However, if you wish to provide a subset or 
different options, you can use `HintOptions` or `HintAction` which will override
the default completion options for `Enum`/`EnumVar`.


**Examples**
You can see an in depth example of the completion API within 
`examples/completion/main.go`


### Supporting -h for help

`kingpin.CommandLine.HelpFlag.Short('h')`

### Custom help

Kingpin v2 supports templatised help using the text/template library (actually, [a fork](https://github.com/alecthomas/template)).

You can specify the template to use with the [Application.UsageTemplate()](http://godoc.org/gopkg.in/alecthomas/kingpin.v2#Application.UsageTemplate) function.

There are four included templates: `kingpin.DefaultUsageTemplate` is the default,
`kingpin.CompactUsageTemplate` provides a more compact representation for more complex command-line structures,
`kingpin.SeparateOptionalFlagsUsageTemplate` looks like the default template, but splits required
and optional command flags into separate lists, and `kingpin.ManPageTemplate` is used to generate man pages.

See the above templates for examples of usage, and the the function [UsageForContextWithTemplate()](https://github.com/alecthomas/kingpin/blob/master/usage.go#L198) method for details on the context.

#### Default help template

```
$ go run ./examples/curl/curl.go --help
usage: curl [<flags>] <command> [<args> ...]

An example implementation of curl.

Flags:
  --help            Show help.
  -t, --timeout=5s  Set connection timeout.
  -H, --headers=HEADER=VALUE
                    Add HTTP headers to the request.

Commands:
  help [<command>...]
    Show help.

  get url <url>
    Retrieve a URL.

  get file <file>
    Retrieve a file.

  post [<flags>] <url>
    POST a resource.
```

#### Compact help template

```
$ go run ./examples/curl/curl.go --help
usage: curl [<flags>] <command> [<args> ...]

An example implementation of curl.

Flags:
  --help            Show help.
  -t, --timeout=5s  Set connection timeout.
  -H, --headers=HEADER=VALUE
                    Add HTTP headers to the request.

Commands:
  help [<command>...]
  get [<flags>]
    url <url>
    file <file>
  post [<flags>] <url>
```

GO-FUSE: native bindings for the FUSE kernel module.


HIGHLIGHTS

* High speed: as fast as libfuse using the gc compiler for single
threaded loads.

* Supports in-process mounting of different FileSystems onto
subdirectories of the FUSE mount.

* Supports 3 interfaces for writing filesystems:
  - PathFileSystem: define filesystems in terms path names.
  - NodeFileSystem: define filesystems in terms of inodes.
  - RawFileSystem: define filesystems in terms of FUSE's raw
  wire protocol.

* Both NodeFileSystem and PathFileSystem support manipulation of true
  hardlinks.

* Includes two fleshed out examples, zipfs and unionfs.


EXAMPLES

* examples/hello/hello.go contains a 60-line "hello world" filesystem

* zipfs/zipfs.go contains a small and simple read-only filesystem for
  zip and tar files. The corresponding command is in example/zipfs/
  For example,

    mkdir /tmp/mountpoint
    example/zipfs/zipfs /tmp/mountpoint file.zip &
    ls /tmp/mountpoint
    fusermount -u /tmp/mountpoint

* zipfs/multizipfs.go shows how to use in-process mounts to
  combine multiple Go-FUSE filesystems into a larger filesystem.

* fuse/loopback.go mounts another piece of the filesystem.
  Functionally, it is similar to a symlink.  A binary to run is in
  example/loopback/ . For example

    mkdir /tmp/mountpoint
    example/loopback/loopback -debug /tmp/mountpoint /some/other/directory &
    ls /tmp/mountpoint
    fusermount -u /tmp/mountpoint

* unionfs/unionfs.go: implements a union mount using 1 R/W branch, and
  multiple R/O branches.

    mkdir -p  /tmp/mountpoint /tmp/writable
    example/unionfs/unionfs /tmp/mountpoint /tmp/writable /usr &
    ls /tmp/mountpoint
    ls -l /tmp/mountpoint/bin/vi
    rm /tmp/mountpoint/bin/vi
    ls -l /tmp/mountpoint/bin/vi
    cat /tmp/writable/*DELETION*/*

* union/autounionfs.go: creates UnionFs mounts automatically based on
  existence of READONLY symlinks.


Tested on:

- x86 32bits (Fedora 14).
- x86 64bits (Ubuntu Lucid).


BENCHMARKS

We use threaded stats over a read-only filesystem for benchmarking.
Automated code is under benchmark/ directory. A simple C version of
the same FS gives a FUSE baseline

Data points (Go-FUSE version May 2012), 1000 files, high level
interface, all kernel caching turned off, median stat time:

platform                    libfuse     Go-FUSE      difference (%)

Lenovo T60/Fedora16 (1cpu)  349us       355us        2% slower
Lenovo T400/Lucid   (1cpu)  138us       140us        5% slower
Dell T3500/Lucid    (1cpu)   72us        76us        5% slower

On T60, for each file we have
- Client side latency is 360us
- 106us of this is server side latency (4.5x lookup 23us, 1x getattr 4us)
- 16.5us is due to latency measurements.
- 3us is due to garbage collection.



MACOS SUPPORT

go-fuse works somewhat on OSX. Known limitations:

* All of the limitations of OSXFUSE, including lack of support for
  NOTIFY.

* OSX issues STATFS calls continuously (leading to performance
  concerns).

* OSX has trouble with concurrent reads from the FUSE device, leading
  to performance concerns.

go-difflib
==========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pmezard/go-difflib.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pmezard/go-difflib)
[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/pmezard/go-difflib/difflib?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/pmezard/go-difflib/difflib)

Go-difflib is a partial port of python 3 difflib package. Its main goal
was to make unified and context diff available in pure Go, mostly for
testing purposes.

The following class and functions (and related tests) have be ported:

* `SequenceMatcher`
* `unified_diff()`
* `context_diff()`

## Installation

```bash
$ go get github.com/pmezard/go-difflib/difflib
```

### Quick Start

Diffs are configured with Unified (or ContextDiff) structures, and can
be output to an io.Writer or returned as a string.

```Go
diff := UnifiedDiff{
    A:        difflib.SplitLines("foo\nbar\n"),
    B:        difflib.SplitLines("foo\nbaz\n"),
    FromFile: "Original",
    ToFile:   "Current",
    Context:  3,
}
text, _ := GetUnifiedDiffString(diff)
fmt.Printf(text)
```

would output:

```
--- Original
+++ Current
@@ -1,3 +1,3 @@
 foo
-bar
+baz
```

Testify - Thou Shalt Write Tests
================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stretchr/testify.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/stretchr/testify)

Go code (golang) set of packages that provide many tools for testifying that your code will behave as you intend.

Features include:

  * [Easy assertions](#assert-package)
  * [Mocking](#mock-package)
  * [HTTP response trapping](#http-package)
  * [Testing suite interfaces and functions](#suite-package)

Get started:

  * Install testify with [one line of code](#installation), or [update it with another](#staying-up-to-date)
  * For an introduction to writing test code in Go, see http://golang.org/doc/code.html#Testing
  * Check out the API Documentation http://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify
  * To make your testing life easier, check out our other project, [gorc](http://github.com/stretchr/gorc)
  * A little about [Test-Driven Development (TDD)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)



[`assert`](http://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/assert "API documentation") package
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `assert` package provides some helpful methods that allow you to write better test code in Go.

  * Prints friendly, easy to read failure descriptions
  * Allows for very readable code
  * Optionally annotate each assertion with a message

See it in action:

```go
package yours

import (
  "testing"
  "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
)

func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {

  // assert equality
  assert.Equal(t, 123, 123, "they should be equal")

  // assert inequality
  assert.NotEqual(t, 123, 456, "they should not be equal")

  // assert for nil (good for errors)
  assert.Nil(t, object)

  // assert for not nil (good when you expect something)
  if assert.NotNil(t, object) {

    // now we know that object isn't nil, we are safe to make
    // further assertions without causing any errors
    assert.Equal(t, "Something", object.Value)

  }

}
```

  * Every assert func takes the `testing.T` object as the first argument.  This is how it writes the errors out through the normal `go test` capabilities.
  * Every assert func returns a bool indicating whether the assertion was successful or not, this is useful for if you want to go on making further assertions under certain conditions.

if you assert many times, use the below:

```go
package yours

import (
  "testing"
  "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
)

func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {
  assert := assert.New(t)

  // assert equality
  assert.Equal(123, 123, "they should be equal")

  // assert inequality
  assert.NotEqual(123, 456, "they should not be equal")

  // assert for nil (good for errors)
  assert.Nil(object)

  // assert for not nil (good when you expect something)
  if assert.NotNil(object) {

    // now we know that object isn't nil, we are safe to make
    // further assertions without causing any errors
    assert.Equal("Something", object.Value)
  }
}
```

[`require`](http://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/require "API documentation") package
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `require` package provides same global functions as the `assert` package, but instead of returning a boolean result they terminate current test.

See [t.FailNow](http://golang.org/pkg/testing/#T.FailNow) for details.


[`http`](http://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/http "API documentation") package
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `http` package contains test objects useful for testing code that relies on the `net/http` package.  Check out the [(deprecated) API documentation for the `http` package](http://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/http).

We recommend you use [httptest](http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/httptest) instead.

[`mock`](http://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/mock "API documentation") package
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `mock` package provides a mechanism for easily writing mock objects that can be used in place of real objects when writing test code.

An example test function that tests a piece of code that relies on an external object `testObj`, can setup expectations (testify) and assert that they indeed happened:

```go
package yours

import (
  "testing"
  "github.com/stretchr/testify/mock"
)

/*
  Test objects
*/

// MyMockedObject is a mocked object that implements an interface
// that describes an object that the code I am testing relies on.
type MyMockedObject struct{
  mock.Mock
}

// DoSomething is a method on MyMockedObject that implements some interface
// and just records the activity, and returns what the Mock object tells it to.
//
// In the real object, this method would do something useful, but since this
// is a mocked object - we're just going to stub it out.
//
// NOTE: This method is not being tested here, code that uses this object is.
func (m *MyMockedObject) DoSomething(number int) (bool, error) {

  args := m.Called(number)
  return args.Bool(0), args.Error(1)

}

/*
  Actual test functions
*/

// TestSomething is an example of how to use our test object to
// make assertions about some target code we are testing.
func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {

  // create an instance of our test object
  testObj := new(MyMockedObject)

  // setup expectations
  testObj.On("DoSomething", 123).Return(true, nil)

  // call the code we are testing
  targetFuncThatDoesSomethingWithObj(testObj)

  // assert that the expectations were met
  testObj.AssertExpectations(t)

}
```

For more information on how to write mock code, check out the [API documentation for the `mock` package](http://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/mock).

You can use the [mockery tool](http://github.com/vektra/mockery) to autogenerate the mock code against an interface as well, making using mocks much quicker.

[`suite`](http://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/suite "API documentation") package
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `suite` package provides functionality that you might be used to from more common object oriented languages.  With it, you can build a testing suite as a struct, build setup/teardown methods and testing methods on your struct, and run them with 'go test' as per normal.

An example suite is shown below:

```go
// Basic imports
import (
    "testing"
    "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
    "github.com/stretchr/testify/suite"
)

// Define the suite, and absorb the built-in basic suite
// functionality from testify - including a T() method which
// returns the current testing context
type ExampleTestSuite struct {
    suite.Suite
    VariableThatShouldStartAtFive int
}

// Make sure that VariableThatShouldStartAtFive is set to five
// before each test
func (suite *ExampleTestSuite) SetupTest() {
    suite.VariableThatShouldStartAtFive = 5
}

// All methods that begin with "Test" are run as tests within a
// suite.
func (suite *ExampleTestSuite) TestExample() {
    assert.Equal(suite.T(), 5, suite.VariableThatShouldStartAtFive)
}

// In order for 'go test' to run this suite, we need to create
// a normal test function and pass our suite to suite.Run
func TestExampleTestSuite(t *testing.T) {
    suite.Run(t, new(ExampleTestSuite))
}
```

For a more complete example, using all of the functionality provided by the suite package, look at our [example testing suite](https://github.com/stretchr/testify/blob/master/suite/suite_test.go)

For more information on writing suites, check out the [API documentation for the `suite` package](http://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/suite).

`Suite` object has assertion methods:

```go
// Basic imports
import (
    "testing"
    "github.com/stretchr/testify/suite"
)

// Define the suite, and absorb the built-in basic suite
// functionality from testify - including assertion methods.
type ExampleTestSuite struct {
    suite.Suite
    VariableThatShouldStartAtFive int
}

// Make sure that VariableThatShouldStartAtFive is set to five
// before each test
func (suite *ExampleTestSuite) SetupTest() {
    suite.VariableThatShouldStartAtFive = 5
}

// All methods that begin with "Test" are run as tests within a
// suite.
func (suite *ExampleTestSuite) TestExample() {
    suite.Equal(suite.VariableThatShouldStartAtFive, 5)
}

// In order for 'go test' to run this suite, we need to create
// a normal test function and pass our suite to suite.Run
func TestExampleTestSuite(t *testing.T) {
    suite.Run(t, new(ExampleTestSuite))
}
```

# Units - Helpful unit multipliers and functions for Go

The goal of this package is to have functionality similar to the [time](http://golang.org/pkg/time/) package.

It allows for code like this:

```go
n, err := ParseBase2Bytes("1KB")
// n == 1024
n = units.Mebibyte * 512
```
# Go's `text/template` package with newline elision

This is a fork of Go 1.4's [text/template](http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/) package with one addition: a backslash immediately after a closing delimiter will delete all subsequent newlines until a non-newline.

eg.

```
{{if true}}\
hello
{{end}}\
```

Will result in:

```
hello\n
```

Rather than:

```
\n
hello\n

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gorilla/mux.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gorilla/mux)

![Gorilla Logo](http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/static/images/gorilla-icon-64.png)

http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/pkg/mux

Package `gorilla/mux` implements a request router and dispatcher for matching incoming requests to
their respective handler.

The name mux stands for "HTTP request multiplexer". Like the standard `http.ServeMux`, `mux.Router` matches incoming requests against a list of registered routes and calls a handler for the route that matches the URL or other conditions. The main features are:

* It implements the `http.Handler` interface so it is compatible with the standard `http.ServeMux`.
* Requests can be matched based on URL host, path, path prefix, schemes, header and query values, HTTP methods or using custom matchers.
* URL hosts and paths can have variables with an optional regular expression.
* Registered URLs can be built, or "reversed", which helps maintaining references to resources.
* Routes can be used as subrouters: nested routes are only tested if the parent route matches. This is useful to define groups of routes that share common conditions like a host, a path prefix or other repeated attributes. As a bonus, this optimizes request matching.

* [Registered URLs](#registered-urls)
* [Full Example](#full-example)

---

## Install

With a [correctly configured](https://golang.org/doc/install#testing) Go toolchain:

```sh
go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux
```

## Examples

Let's start registering a couple of URL paths and handlers:

```go
func main() {
	r := mux.NewRouter()
	r.HandleFunc("/", HomeHandler)
	r.HandleFunc("/products", ProductsHandler)
	r.HandleFunc("/articles", ArticlesHandler)
	http.Handle("/", r)
}
```

Here we register three routes mapping URL paths to handlers. This is equivalent to how `http.HandleFunc()` works: if an incoming request URL matches one of the paths, the corresponding handler is called passing (`http.ResponseWriter`, `*http.Request`) as parameters.

Paths can have variables. They are defined using the format `{name}` or `{name:pattern}`. If a regular expression pattern is not defined, the matched variable will be anything until the next slash. For example:

```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
r.HandleFunc("/products/{key}", ProductHandler)
r.HandleFunc("/articles/{category}/", ArticlesCategoryHandler)
r.HandleFunc("/articles/{category}/{id:[0-9]+}", ArticleHandler)
```

The names are used to create a map of route variables which can be retrieved calling `mux.Vars()`:

```go
vars := mux.Vars(request)
category := vars["category"]
```

And this is all you need to know about the basic usage. More advanced options are explained below.

### Matching Routes

Routes can also be restricted to a domain or subdomain. Just define a host pattern to be matched. They can also have variables:

```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
// Only matches if domain is "www.example.com".
r.Host("www.example.com")
// Matches a dynamic subdomain.
r.Host("{subdomain:[a-z]+}.domain.com")
```

There are several other matchers that can be added. To match path prefixes:

```go
r.PathPrefix("/products/")
```

...or HTTP methods:

```go
r.Methods("GET", "POST")
```

...or URL schemes:

```go
r.Schemes("https")
```

...or header values:

```go
r.Headers("X-Requested-With", "XMLHttpRequest")
```

...or query values:

```go
r.Queries("key", "value")
```

...or to use a custom matcher function:

```go
r.MatcherFunc(func(r *http.Request, rm *RouteMatch) bool {
	return r.ProtoMajor == 0
})
```

...and finally, it is possible to combine several matchers in a single route:

```go
r.HandleFunc("/products", ProductsHandler).
  Host("www.example.com").
  Methods("GET").
  Schemes("http")
```

Setting the same matching conditions again and again can be boring, so we have a way to group several routes that share the same requirements. We call it "subrouting".

For example, let's say we have several URLs that should only match when the host is `www.example.com`. Create a route for that host and get a "subrouter" from it:

```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
s := r.Host("www.example.com").Subrouter()
```

Then register routes in the subrouter:

```go
s.HandleFunc("/products/", ProductsHandler)
s.HandleFunc("/products/{key}", ProductHandler)
s.HandleFunc("/articles/{category}/{id:[0-9]+}", ArticleHandler)
```

The three URL paths we registered above will only be tested if the domain is `www.example.com`, because the subrouter is tested first. This is not only convenient, but also optimizes request matching. You can create subrouters combining any attribute matchers accepted by a route.

Subrouters can be used to create domain or path "namespaces": you define subrouters in a central place and then parts of the app can register its paths relatively to a given subrouter.

There's one more thing about subroutes. When a subrouter has a path prefix, the inner routes use it as base for their paths:

```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
s := r.PathPrefix("/products").Subrouter()
// "/products/"
s.HandleFunc("/", ProductsHandler)
// "/products/{key}/"
s.HandleFunc("/{key}/", ProductHandler)
// "/products/{key}/details"
s.HandleFunc("/{key}/details", ProductDetailsHandler)
```

### Static Files

Note that the path provided to `PathPrefix()` represents a "wildcard": calling
`PathPrefix("/static/").Handler(...)` means that the handler will be passed any
request that matches "/static/*". This makes it easy to serve static files with mux:

```go
func main() {
	var dir string

	flag.StringVar(&dir, "dir", ".", "the directory to serve files from. Defaults to the current dir")
	flag.Parse()
	r := mux.NewRouter()

	// This will serve files under http://localhost:8000/static/<filename>
	r.PathPrefix("/static/").Handler(http.StripPrefix("/static/", http.FileServer(http.Dir(dir))))

	srv := &http.Server{
		Handler:      r,
		Addr:         "127.0.0.1:8000",
		// Good practice: enforce timeouts for servers you create!
		WriteTimeout: 15 * time.Second,
		ReadTimeout:  15 * time.Second,
	}

	log.Fatal(srv.ListenAndServe())
}
```

### Registered URLs

Now let's see how to build registered URLs.

Routes can be named. All routes that define a name can have their URLs built, or "reversed". We define a name calling `Name()` on a route. For example:

```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
r.HandleFunc("/articles/{category}/{id:[0-9]+}", ArticleHandler).
  Name("article")
```

To build a URL, get the route and call the `URL()` method, passing a sequence of key/value pairs for the route variables. For the previous route, we would do:

```go
url, err := r.Get("article").URL("category", "technology", "id", "42")
```

...and the result will be a `url.URL` with the following path:

```
"/articles/technology/42"
```

This also works for host variables:

```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
r.Host("{subdomain}.domain.com").
  Path("/articles/{category}/{id:[0-9]+}").
  HandlerFunc(ArticleHandler).
  Name("article")

// url.String() will be "http://news.domain.com/articles/technology/42"
url, err := r.Get("article").URL("subdomain", "news",
                                 "category", "technology",
                                 "id", "42")
```

All variables defined in the route are required, and their values must conform to the corresponding patterns. These requirements guarantee that a generated URL will always match a registered route -- the only exception is for explicitly defined "build-only" routes which never match.

Regex support also exists for matching Headers within a route. For example, we could do:

```go
r.HeadersRegexp("Content-Type", "application/(text|json)")
```

...and the route will match both requests with a Content-Type of `application/json` as well as `application/text`

There's also a way to build only the URL host or path for a route: use the methods `URLHost()` or `URLPath()` instead. For the previous route, we would do:

```go
// "http://news.domain.com/"
host, err := r.Get("article").URLHost("subdomain", "news")

// "/articles/technology/42"
path, err := r.Get("article").URLPath("category", "technology", "id", "42")
```

And if you use subrouters, host and path defined separately can be built as well:

```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
s := r.Host("{subdomain}.domain.com").Subrouter()
s.Path("/articles/{category}/{id:[0-9]+}").
  HandlerFunc(ArticleHandler).
  Name("article")

// "http://news.domain.com/articles/technology/42"
url, err := r.Get("article").URL("subdomain", "news",
                                 "category", "technology",
                                 "id", "42")
```

## Full Example

Here's a complete, runnable example of a small `mux` based server:

```go
package main

import (
	"net/http"
	"log"
	"github.com/gorilla/mux"
)

func YourHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	w.Write([]byte("Gorilla!\n"))
}

func main() {
	r := mux.NewRouter()
	// Routes consist of a path and a handler function.
	r.HandleFunc("/", YourHandler)

	// Bind to a port and pass our router in
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8000", r))
}
```

Go port of Coda Hale's Metrics library: <https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics>.

Documentation: <http://godoc.org/github.com/rcrowley/go-metrics>.

Usage
-----

Create and update metrics:

```go
c := metrics.NewCounter()
metrics.Register("foo", c)
c.Inc(47)

g := metrics.NewGauge()
metrics.Register("bar", g)
g.Update(47)

s := metrics.NewExpDecaySample(1028, 0.015) // or metrics.NewUniformSample(1028)
h := metrics.NewHistogram(s)
metrics.Register("baz", h)
h.Update(47)

m := metrics.NewMeter()
metrics.Register("quux", m)
m.Mark(47)

t := metrics.NewTimer()
metrics.Register("bang", t)
t.Time(func() {})
t.Update(47)
```

Periodically log every metric in human-readable form to standard error:

```go
go metrics.Log(metrics.DefaultRegistry, 5 * time.Second, log.New(os.Stderr, "metrics: ", log.Lmicroseconds))
```

Periodically log every metric in slightly-more-parseable form to syslog:

```go
w, _ := syslog.Dial("unixgram", "/dev/log", syslog.LOG_INFO, "metrics")
go metrics.Syslog(metrics.DefaultRegistry, 60e9, w)
```

Periodically emit every metric to Graphite using the [Graphite client](https://github.com/cyberdelia/go-metrics-graphite):

```go

import "github.com/cyberdelia/go-metrics-graphite"

addr, _ := net.ResolveTCPAddr("tcp", "127.0.0.1:2003")
go graphite.Graphite(metrics.DefaultRegistry, 10e9, "metrics", addr)
```

Periodically emit every metric into InfluxDB:

**NOTE:** this has been pulled out of the library due to constant fluctuations
in the InfluxDB API. In fact, all client libraries are on their way out. see
issues [#121](https://github.com/rcrowley/go-metrics/issues/121) and
[#124](https://github.com/rcrowley/go-metrics/issues/124) for progress and details.

```go
import "github.com/rcrowley/go-metrics/influxdb"

go influxdb.Influxdb(metrics.DefaultRegistry, 10e9, &influxdb.Config{
    Host:     "127.0.0.1:8086",
    Database: "metrics",
    Username: "test",
    Password: "test",
})
```

Periodically upload every metric to Librato using the [Librato client](https://github.com/mihasya/go-metrics-librato):

**Note**: the client included with this repository under the `librato` package
has been deprecated and moved to the repository linked above.

```go
import "github.com/mihasya/go-metrics-librato"

go librato.Librato(metrics.DefaultRegistry,
    10e9,                  // interval
    "example@example.com", // account owner email address
    "token",               // Librato API token
    "hostname",            // source
    []float64{0.95},       // percentiles to send
    time.Millisecond,      // time unit
)
```

Periodically emit every metric to StatHat:

```go
import "github.com/rcrowley/go-metrics/stathat"

go stathat.Stathat(metrics.DefaultRegistry, 10e9, "example@example.com")
```

Maintain all metrics along with expvars at `/debug/metrics`:

This uses the same mechanism as [the official expvar](http://golang.org/pkg/expvar/)
but exposed under `/debug/metrics`, which shows a json representation of all your usual expvars
as well as all your go-metrics.


```go
import "github.com/rcrowley/go-metrics/exp"

exp.Exp(metrics.DefaultRegistry)
```

Installation
------------

```sh
go get github.com/rcrowley/go-metrics
```

StatHat support additionally requires their Go client:

```sh
go get github.com/stathat/go
```

(https://travis-ci.org/davecgh/go-spew) [![Coverage Status]
(https://coveralls.io/repos/davecgh/go-spew/badge.png?branch=master)]
(https://coveralls.io/r/davecgh/go-spew?branch=master)

Go-spew implements a deep pretty printer for Go data structures to aid in
debugging.  A comprehensive suite of tests with 100% test coverage is provided
to ensure proper functionality.  See `test_coverage.txt` for the gocov coverage
report.  Go-spew is licensed under the liberal ISC license, so it may be used in
open source or commercial projects.

If you're interested in reading about how this package came to life and some
of the challenges involved in providing a deep pretty printer, there is a blog
post about it
[here](https://blog.cyphertite.com/go-spew-a-journey-into-dumping-go-data-structures/).

## Documentation

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/davecgh/go-spew/spew?status.png)]
(http://godoc.org/github.com/davecgh/go-spew/spew)

Full `go doc` style documentation for the project can be viewed online without
installing this package by using the excellent GoDoc site here:
http://godoc.org/github.com/davecgh/go-spew/spew

You can also view the documentation locally once the package is installed with
the `godoc` tool by running `godoc -http=":6060"` and pointing your browser to
http://localhost:6060/pkg/github.com/davecgh/go-spew/spew

## Installation

```bash
$ go get -u github.com/davecgh/go-spew/spew
```

## Quick Start

Add this import line to the file you're working in:

```Go
import "github.com/davecgh/go-spew/spew"
```

To dump a variable with full newlines, indentation, type, and pointer
information use Dump, Fdump, or Sdump:

```Go
spew.Dump(myVar1, myVar2, ...)
spew.Fdump(someWriter, myVar1, myVar2, ...)
str := spew.Sdump(myVar1, myVar2, ...)
```

Alternatively, if you would prefer to use format strings with a compacted inline
printing style, use the convenience wrappers Printf, Fprintf, etc with %v (most
compact), %+v (adds pointer addresses), %#v (adds types), or %#+v (adds types
and pointer addresses): 

```Go
spew.Printf("myVar1: %v -- myVar2: %+v", myVar1, myVar2)
spew.Printf("myVar3: %#v -- myVar4: %#+v", myVar3, myVar4)
spew.Fprintf(someWriter, "myVar1: %v -- myVar2: %+v", myVar1, myVar2)
spew.Fprintf(someWriter, "myVar3: %#v -- myVar4: %#+v", myVar3, myVar4)
```

## Debugging a Web Application Example

Here is an example of how you can use `spew.Sdump()` to help debug a web application. Please be sure to wrap your output using the `html.EscapeString()` function for safety reasons. You should also only use this debugging technique in a development environment, never in production.

```Go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "html"
    "net/http"

    "github.com/davecgh/go-spew/spew"
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "text/html")
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hi there, %s!", r.URL.Path[1:])
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "<!--\n" + html.EscapeString(spew.Sdump(w)) + "\n-->")
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

## Sample Dump Output

```
(main.Foo) {
 unexportedField: (*main.Bar)(0xf84002e210)({
  flag: (main.Flag) flagTwo,
  data: (uintptr) <nil>
 }),
 ExportedField: (map[interface {}]interface {}) {
  (string) "one": (bool) true
 }
}
([]uint8) {
 00000000  11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18  19 1a 1b 1c 1d 1e 1f 20  |............... |
 00000010  21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  29 2a 2b 2c 2d 2e 2f 30  |!"#$%&'()*+,-./0|
 00000020  31 32                                             |12|
}
```

## Sample Formatter Output

Double pointer to a uint8:
```
	  %v: <**>5
	 %+v: <**>(0xf8400420d0->0xf8400420c8)5
	 %#v: (**uint8)5
	%#+v: (**uint8)(0xf8400420d0->0xf8400420c8)5
```

Pointer to circular struct with a uint8 field and a pointer to itself:
```
	  %v: <*>{1 <*><shown>}
	 %+v: <*>(0xf84003e260){ui8:1 c:<*>(0xf84003e260)<shown>}
	 %#v: (*main.circular){ui8:(uint8)1 c:(*main.circular)<shown>}
	%#+v: (*main.circular)(0xf84003e260){ui8:(uint8)1 c:(*main.circular)(0xf84003e260)<shown>}
```

## Configuration Options

Configuration of spew is handled by fields in the ConfigState type. For
convenience, all of the top-level functions use a global state available via the
spew.Config global.

It is also possible to create a ConfigState instance that provides methods
equivalent to the top-level functions. This allows concurrent configuration
options. See the ConfigState documentation for more details.

```
* Indent
	String to use for each indentation level for Dump functions.
	It is a single space by default.  A popular alternative is "\t".

* MaxDepth
	Maximum number of levels to descend into nested data structures.
	There is no limit by default.

* DisableMethods
	Disables invocation of error and Stringer interface methods.
	Method invocation is enabled by default.

* DisablePointerMethods
	Disables invocation of error and Stringer interface methods on types
	which only accept pointer receivers from non-pointer variables.  This option
	relies on access to the unsafe package, so it will not have any effect when
	running in environments without access to the unsafe package such as Google
	App Engine or with the "disableunsafe" build tag specified.
	Pointer method invocation is enabled by default.

* ContinueOnMethod
	Enables recursion into types after invoking error and Stringer interface
	methods. Recursion after method invocation is disabled by default.

* SortKeys
	Specifies map keys should be sorted before being printed. Use
	this to have a more deterministic, diffable output.  Note that
	only native types (bool, int, uint, floats, uintptr and string)
	and types which implement error or Stringer interfaces are supported,
	with other types sorted according to the reflect.Value.String() output
	which guarantees display stability.  Natural map order is used by
	default.

* SpewKeys
	SpewKeys specifies that, as a last resort attempt, map keys should be
	spewed to strings and sorted by those strings.  This is only considered
	if SortKeys is true.

```

## Unsafe Package Dependency

This package relies on the unsafe package to perform some of the more advanced
features, however it also supports a "limited" mode which allows it to work in
environments where the unsafe package is not available.  By default, it will
operate in this mode on Google App Engine.  The "disableunsafe" build tag may
also be specified to force the package to build without using the unsafe
package.

Testify - Thou Shalt Write Tests
================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stretchr/testify.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/stretchr/testify) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/stretchr/testify)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/stretchr/testify) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify)

Go code (golang) set of packages that provide many tools for testifying that your code will behave as you intend.

Features include:

  * [Easy assertions](#assert-package)
  * [Mocking](#mock-package)
  * [HTTP response trapping](#http-package)
  * [Testing suite interfaces and functions](#suite-package)

Get started:

  * Install testify with [one line of code](#installation), or [update it with another](#staying-up-to-date)
  * For an introduction to writing test code in Go, see http://golang.org/doc/code.html#Testing
  * Check out the API Documentation http://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify
  * To make your testing life easier, check out our other project, [gorc](http://github.com/stretchr/gorc)
  * A little about [Test-Driven Development (TDD)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)



[`assert`](http://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/assert "API documentation") package
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `assert` package provides some helpful methods that allow you to write better test code in Go.

  * Prints friendly, easy to read failure descriptions
  * Allows for very readable code
  * Optionally annotate each assertion with a message

See it in action:

```go
package yours

import (
  "testing"
  "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
)

func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {

  // assert equality
  assert.Equal(t, 123, 123, "they should be equal")

  // assert inequality
  assert.NotEqual(t, 123, 456, "they should not be equal")

  // assert for nil (good for errors)
  assert.Nil(t, object)

  // assert for not nil (good when you expect something)
  if assert.NotNil(t, object) {

    // now we know that object isn't nil, we are safe to make
    // further assertions without causing any errors
    assert.Equal(t, "Something", object.Value)

  }

}
```

  * Every assert func takes the `testing.T` object as the first argument.  This is how it writes the errors out through the normal `go test` capabilities.
  * Every assert func returns a bool indicating whether the assertion was successful or not, this is useful for if you want to go on making further assertions under certain conditions.

if you assert many times, use the below:

```go
package yours

import (
  "testing"
  "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
)

func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {
  assert := assert.New(t)

  // assert equality
  assert.Equal(123, 123, "they should be equal")

  // assert inequality
  assert.NotEqual(123, 456, "they should not be equal")

  // assert for nil (good for errors)
  assert.Nil(object)

  // assert for not nil (good when you expect something)
  if assert.NotNil(object) {

    // now we know that object isn't nil, we are safe to make
    // further assertions without causing any errors
    assert.Equal("Something", object.Value)
  }
}
```

[`require`](http://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/require "API documentation") package
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `require` package provides same global functions as the `assert` package, but instead of returning a boolean result they terminate current test.

See [t.FailNow](http://golang.org/pkg/testing/#T.FailNow) for details.


[`http`](http://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/http "API documentation") package
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `http` package contains test objects useful for testing code that relies on the `net/http` package.  Check out the [(deprecated) API documentation for the `http` package](http://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/http).

We recommend you use [httptest](http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/httptest) instead.

[`mock`](http://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/mock "API documentation") package
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `mock` package provides a mechanism for easily writing mock objects that can be used in place of real objects when writing test code.

An example test function that tests a piece of code that relies on an external object `testObj`, can setup expectations (testify) and assert that they indeed happened:

```go
package yours

import (
  "testing"
  "github.com/stretchr/testify/mock"
)

/*
  Test objects
*/

// MyMockedObject is a mocked object that implements an interface
// that describes an object that the code I am testing relies on.
type MyMockedObject struct{
  mock.Mock
}

// DoSomething is a method on MyMockedObject that implements some interface
// and just records the activity, and returns what the Mock object tells it to.
//
// In the real object, this method would do something useful, but since this
// is a mocked object - we're just going to stub it out.
//
// NOTE: This method is not being tested here, code that uses this object is.
func (m *MyMockedObject) DoSomething(number int) (bool, error) {

  args := m.Called(number)
  return args.Bool(0), args.Error(1)

}

/*
  Actual test functions
*/

// TestSomething is an example of how to use our test object to
// make assertions about some target code we are testing.
func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {

  // create an instance of our test object
  testObj := new(MyMockedObject)

  // setup expectations
  testObj.On("DoSomething", 123).Return(true, nil)

  // call the code we are testing
  targetFuncThatDoesSomethingWithObj(testObj)

  // assert that the expectations were met
  testObj.AssertExpectations(t)

}
```

For more information on how to write mock code, check out the [API documentation for the `mock` package](http://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/mock).

You can use the [mockery tool](http://github.com/vektra/mockery) to autogenerate the mock code against an interface as well, making using mocks much quicker.

[`suite`](http://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/suite "API documentation") package
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `suite` package provides functionality that you might be used to from more common object oriented languages.  With it, you can build a testing suite as a struct, build setup/teardown methods and testing methods on your struct, and run them with 'go test' as per normal.

An example suite is shown below:

```go
// Basic imports
import (
    "testing"
    "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
    "github.com/stretchr/testify/suite"
)

// Define the suite, and absorb the built-in basic suite
// functionality from testify - including a T() method which
// returns the current testing context
type ExampleTestSuite struct {
    suite.Suite
    VariableThatShouldStartAtFive int
}

// Make sure that VariableThatShouldStartAtFive is set to five
// before each test
func (suite *ExampleTestSuite) SetupTest() {
    suite.VariableThatShouldStartAtFive = 5
}

// All methods that begin with "Test" are run as tests within a
// suite.
func (suite *ExampleTestSuite) TestExample() {
    assert.Equal(suite.T(), 5, suite.VariableThatShouldStartAtFive)
}

// In order for 'go test' to run this suite, we need to create
// a normal test function and pass our suite to suite.Run
func TestExampleTestSuite(t *testing.T) {
    suite.Run(t, new(ExampleTestSuite))
}
```

For a more complete example, using all of the functionality provided by the suite package, look at our [example testing suite](https://github.com/stretchr/testify/blob/master/suite/suite_test.go)

For more information on writing suites, check out the [API documentation for the `suite` package](http://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/suite).

`Suite` object has assertion methods:

```go
// Basic imports
import (
    "testing"
    "github.com/stretchr/testify/suite"
)

// Define the suite, and absorb the built-in basic suite
// functionality from testify - including assertion methods.
type ExampleTestSuite struct {
    suite.Suite
    VariableThatShouldStartAtFive int
}

// Make sure that VariableThatShouldStartAtFive is set to five
// before each test
func (suite *ExampleTestSuite) SetupTest() {
    suite.VariableThatShouldStartAtFive = 5
}

// All methods that begin with "Test" are run as tests within a
// suite.
func (suite *ExampleTestSuite) TestExample() {
    suite.Equal(suite.VariableThatShouldStartAtFive, 5)
}

// In order for 'go test' to run this suite, we need to create
// a normal test function and pass our suite to suite.Run
func TestExampleTestSuite(t *testing.T) {
    suite.Run(t, new(ExampleTestSuite))
}
```

mux
===
[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/gorilla/mux?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/gorilla/mux)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gorilla/mux.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gorilla/mux)

http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/pkg/mux

Package `gorilla/mux` implements a request router and dispatcher.

The name mux stands for "HTTP request multiplexer". Like the standard `http.ServeMux`, `mux.Router` matches incoming requests against a list of registered routes and calls a handler for the route that matches the URL or other conditions. The main features are:

* Requests can be matched based on URL host, path, path prefix, schemes, header and query values, HTTP methods or using custom matchers.
* URL hosts and paths can have variables with an optional regular expression.
* Registered URLs can be built, or "reversed", which helps maintaining references to resources.
* Routes can be used as subrouters: nested routes are only tested if the parent route matches. This is useful to define groups of routes that share common conditions like a host, a path prefix or other repeated attributes. As a bonus, this optimizes request matching.
* It implements the `http.Handler` interface so it is compatible with the standard `http.ServeMux`.

Let's start registering a couple of URL paths and handlers:

```go
func main() {
	r := mux.NewRouter()
	r.HandleFunc("/", HomeHandler)
	r.HandleFunc("/products", ProductsHandler)
	r.HandleFunc("/articles", ArticlesHandler)
	http.Handle("/", r)
}
```

Here we register three routes mapping URL paths to handlers. This is equivalent to how `http.HandleFunc()` works: if an incoming request URL matches one of the paths, the corresponding handler is called passing (`http.ResponseWriter`, `*http.Request`) as parameters.

Paths can have variables. They are defined using the format `{name}` or `{name:pattern}`. If a regular expression pattern is not defined, the matched variable will be anything until the next slash. For example:

```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
r.HandleFunc("/products/{key}", ProductHandler)
r.HandleFunc("/articles/{category}/", ArticlesCategoryHandler)
r.HandleFunc("/articles/{category}/{id:[0-9]+}", ArticleHandler)
```

The names are used to create a map of route variables which can be retrieved calling `mux.Vars()`:

```go
vars := mux.Vars(request)
category := vars["category"]
```

And this is all you need to know about the basic usage. More advanced options are explained below.

Routes can also be restricted to a domain or subdomain. Just define a host pattern to be matched. They can also have variables:

```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
// Only matches if domain is "www.example.com".
r.Host("www.example.com")
// Matches a dynamic subdomain.
r.Host("{subdomain:[a-z]+}.domain.com")
```

There are several other matchers that can be added. To match path prefixes:

```go
r.PathPrefix("/products/")
```

...or HTTP methods:

```go
r.Methods("GET", "POST")
```

...or URL schemes:

```go
r.Schemes("https")
```

...or header values:

```go
r.Headers("X-Requested-With", "XMLHttpRequest")
```

...or query values:

```go
r.Queries("key", "value")
```

...or to use a custom matcher function:

```go
r.MatcherFunc(func(r *http.Request, rm *RouteMatch) bool {
	return r.ProtoMajor == 0
})
```

...and finally, it is possible to combine several matchers in a single route:

```go
r.HandleFunc("/products", ProductsHandler).
  Host("www.example.com").
  Methods("GET").
  Schemes("http")
```

Setting the same matching conditions again and again can be boring, so we have a way to group several routes that share the same requirements. We call it "subrouting".

For example, let's say we have several URLs that should only match when the host is `www.example.com`. Create a route for that host and get a "subrouter" from it:

```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
s := r.Host("www.example.com").Subrouter()
```

Then register routes in the subrouter:

```go
s.HandleFunc("/products/", ProductsHandler)
s.HandleFunc("/products/{key}", ProductHandler)
s.HandleFunc("/articles/{category}/{id:[0-9]+}"), ArticleHandler)
```

The three URL paths we registered above will only be tested if the domain is `www.example.com`, because the subrouter is tested first. This is not only convenient, but also optimizes request matching. You can create subrouters combining any attribute matchers accepted by a route.

Subrouters can be used to create domain or path "namespaces": you define subrouters in a central place and then parts of the app can register its paths relatively to a given subrouter.

There's one more thing about subroutes. When a subrouter has a path prefix, the inner routes use it as base for their paths:

```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
s := r.PathPrefix("/products").Subrouter()
// "/products/"
s.HandleFunc("/", ProductsHandler)
// "/products/{key}/"
s.HandleFunc("/{key}/", ProductHandler)
// "/products/{key}/details"
s.HandleFunc("/{key}/details", ProductDetailsHandler)
```

Now let's see how to build registered URLs.

Routes can be named. All routes that define a name can have their URLs built, or "reversed". We define a name calling `Name()` on a route. For example:

```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
r.HandleFunc("/articles/{category}/{id:[0-9]+}", ArticleHandler).
  Name("article")
```

To build a URL, get the route and call the `URL()` method, passing a sequence of key/value pairs for the route variables. For the previous route, we would do:

```go
url, err := r.Get("article").URL("category", "technology", "id", "42")
```

...and the result will be a `url.URL` with the following path:

```
"/articles/technology/42"
```

This also works for host variables:

```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
r.Host("{subdomain}.domain.com").
  Path("/articles/{category}/{id:[0-9]+}").
  HandlerFunc(ArticleHandler).
  Name("article")

// url.String() will be "http://news.domain.com/articles/technology/42"
url, err := r.Get("article").URL("subdomain", "news",
                                 "category", "technology",
                                 "id", "42")
```

All variables defined in the route are required, and their values must conform to the corresponding patterns. These requirements guarantee that a generated URL will always match a registered route -- the only exception is for explicitly defined "build-only" routes which never match.

Regex support also exists for matching Headers within a route. For example, we could do:

```go
r.HeadersRegexp("Content-Type", "application/(text|json)")
```

...and the route will match both requests with a Content-Type of `application/json` as well as `application/text`

There's also a way to build only the URL host or path for a route: use the methods `URLHost()` or `URLPath()` instead. For the previous route, we would do:

```go
// "http://news.domain.com/"
host, err := r.Get("article").URLHost("subdomain", "news")

// "/articles/technology/42"
path, err := r.Get("article").URLPath("category", "technology", "id", "42")
```

And if you use subrouters, host and path defined separately can be built as well:

```go
r := mux.NewRouter()
s := r.Host("{subdomain}.domain.com").Subrouter()
s.Path("/articles/{category}/{id:[0-9]+}").
  HandlerFunc(ArticleHandler).
  Name("article")

// "http://news.domain.com/articles/technology/42"
url, err := r.Get("article").URL("subdomain", "news",
                                 "category", "technology",
                                 "id", "42")
```

## Full Example

Here's a complete, runnable example of a small `mux` based server:

```go
