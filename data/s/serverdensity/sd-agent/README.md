[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/serverdensity/sd-agent.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/serverdensity/sd-agent)

This is the source code for the Server Density agent (v2). If you're looking to install the agent, we also provide [pre-packaged binaries](https://support.serverdensity.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001083126) for most operating systems.

# Release notes
See [agent release notes](https://support.serverdensity.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001065423).


# Agent configuration

If you are using packages on Linux, the main configuration file can be found
in `/etc/sd-agent/config.cfg`. Per-check configuration files are in
`/etc/sd-agent/conf.d`. We provide an example in the same directory
that you can use as a template.

Our legacy [v1 agent source code](https://github.com/serverdensity/sd-agent/tree/v1) is still available but will soon be sunset.

"old style" plugins are fully usable with the v2 agent.
