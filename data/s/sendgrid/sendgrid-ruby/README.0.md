# Installation

In addition to the installation instructions in
[the main readme](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-ruby/tree/master/#installation),
you must also add sinatra to your Gemfile:

```
gem 'sinatra', '>= 1.4.7', '< 3'
```


# Quick Start for Local Testing with Sample Data

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-ruby.git
cd sendgrid-ruby
bundle install
```

Run the Inbound Parse listener in your terminal:

```ruby
rackup
```

In another terminal, run the test data sender:

```bash
cd [path to sendgrid-ruby]
bundle install
ruby ./lib/sendgrid/helpers/inbound/send.rb ./lib/sendgrid/helpers/inbound/sample_data/default_data.txt
```

More sample data can be found [here](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-ruby/tree/master/lib/sendgrid/helpers/inbound/sample_data).

View the results in the first terminal.

# Quick Start for Local Testing with Real Data

[Setup your MX records.](https://sendgrid.com/docs/Classroom/Basics/Inbound_Parse_Webhook/setting_up_the_inbound_parse_webhook.html#-Setup) Depending on your domain name host, you may need to wait up to 48 hours for the settings to propagate.

Run the Inbound Parse listener in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-ruby.git
cd sendgrid-ruby
bundle install
rackup
```

In another terminal, use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to allow external access to your machine:
```bash
ngrok http 9292
```

Update your SendGrid Incoming Parse settings: [Settings Page](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/parse) | [Docs](https://sendgrid.com/docs/Classroom/Basics/Inbound_Parse_Webhook/setting_up_the_inbound_parse_webhook.html#-Pointing-to-a-Hostname-and-URL)

- For the HOSTNAME field, use the domain that you changed the MX records (e.g. inbound.yourdomain.com)
- For the URL field, use the URL generated by ngrok + /inbound, e.g http://XXXXXXX.ngrok.io/inbound

Next, send an email to [anything]@inbound.yourdomain.com, then look at the terminal where you started the Inbound Parse listener.

# Code Walkthrough

## app.rb

This module runs a [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) server, that by default (you can change those settings [here](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-ruby/blob/master/sendgrid/helpers/inbound/config.yml)), listens for POSTs on http://localhost:9292. When the server receives the POST, it parses and prints the key/value data.

## config.yml

This module loads application environment variables (located in [config.yml](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-ruby/blob/master/sendgrid/helpers/inbound/config.yml)).

## send.rb & /sample_data

This module is used to send sample test data. It is useful for testing and development, particularly while you wait for your MX records to propagate.

If you would like to contribute to this project, please see our [contributing guide](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-ruby/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). Thanks!
**This module allows you to quickly and easily build a Settings object for retrieving or updating you SendGrid Settings.**

# Quick Start

Run the [example](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-ruby/tree/master/examples/helpers/settings) (make sure you have set your environment variable to include your SENDGRID_API_KEY).

```bash
ruby examples/helpers/settings/example.rb
```

## Usage

- See the [example](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-ruby/tree/master/examples/helpers/settings) for a complete working example.
- [Documentation](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/Settings/index.html)
**This helper allows you to quickly and easily build a Mail object for sending email through SendGrid.**

# Quick Start

Run the [example](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-ruby/tree/master/examples/helpers/mail) (make sure you have set your environment variable to include your SENDGRID_API_KEY).

```bash
ruby examples/helpers/mail/example.rb
```

## Usage

- See the [example](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-ruby/tree/master/examples/helpers/mail) for a complete working example.
- [Documentation](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/Mail/overview.html)# Docker image for sendgrid-ruby

## Quickstart
1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) on your machine.
2. Run `docker run --rm -it sendgrid/sendgrid-ruby irb`.
3. Run `require './lib/sendgrid-ruby.rb'`.

## Poke around

If you would like to just poke around in the image and check some examples:
```sh
docker run --rm -it sendgrid/sendgrid-ruby bash
```

If you want to mount your fork or specific version of the gem:
```sh
docker run --rm -v /path/to/local/sendgrid-ruby:/sources/sendgrid-ruby -it sendgrid/sendgrid-ruby bash
```

## Running tests

If you would like to run the tests present in the image:
```sh
docker run --rm sendgrid/sendgrid-ruby rake
```

If you want to run tests on your fork or a specific version, mount the codebase onto the image:
```sh
docker run --rm -v /path/to/local/sendgrid-ruby:/sources/sendgrid-ruby sendgrid/sendgrid-ruby rake
```
