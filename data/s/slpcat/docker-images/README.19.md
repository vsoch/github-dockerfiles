This directory contains the Helm Chart required
to do a complete Pulsar deployment on Kubernetes.

## Install Helm

Before you start, you need to install helm.
Following [helm documentation](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-helm) to install it.

## Deploy Pulsar

### Minikube

#### Install Minikube

[Install and configure minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube#installation) with
a [VM driver](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube#requirements), e.g. `kvm2` on Linux
or `hyperkit` or `VirtualBox` on macOS.

#### Create a K8S cluster on Minikube

```
minikube start --memory=8192 --cpus=4 \
    --kubernetes-version=v1.10.5
```

#### Set kubectl to use Minikube.

```
kubectl config use-context minikube
```

After you created a K8S cluster on Minikube, you can access its dashboard via following command:

```
minikube dashboard
```

The command will automatically trigger open a webpage in your browser.

#### Install Pulsar Chart

Assume you already cloned pulsar repo in `PULSAR_HOME` directory.

1. Go to Pulsar helm chart directory
    ```shell
    cd ${PULSAR_HOME}/deployment/kubernetes/helm
    ```
1. Install helm chart.
    ```shell
    helm install --values pulsar/values-mini.yaml ./pulsar
    ```

Once the helm chart is completed on installation, you can access the cluster via:

- Web service url: `http://$(minikube ip):30001/`
- Pulsar service url: `pulsar://$(minikube ip):30002/`
