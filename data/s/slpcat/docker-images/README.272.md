Example of Image with WLS Domain
================================
This Dockerfile extends the Oracle WebLogic image built under 1221-domain with tag name '1221-domain'

It will deploy during Docker image build phase, using a WLST Offline script, any package defined in APP_PKG_FILE located in APP_PKG_LOCATION into the DOMAIN_HOME with name defined in APP_NAME

# How to build and run
First make sure you have built sample image inside **1221-domain**. Now to build this sample, run:

        $ docker build -t 1221-appdeploy .

To start the containerized Admin Server, run:

        $ docker run -d --name wlsadmin --hostname wlsadmin -p 7001:7001 1221-appdeploy

To start a containerized Managed Server to self-register with the Admin Server above, run:

        $ docker run -d --link wlsadmin:wlsadmin -p 7002:7002 1221-appdeploy createServer.sh

To access the sample application, go to **http://localhost:7001/sample**.
