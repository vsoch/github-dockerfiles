# Deepcut

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/rkcosmos/deepcut/blob/master/LICENSE)

A Thai word tokenization library using Deep Neural Network.

## What's new?

* v0.5.2.0: Better weight matrix
* v0.5.1.0: Faster tokenization by code refactorization from our new contributor: Titipat Achakulvisut

## Performance

The Convolutional Neural network is trained from 90% of NECTEC's BEST corpus
(consists of 4 sections, article, news, novel and encyclopedia) and test on the rest 10%.
It is a binary classification model trying to predict whether a character is the beginning of word or not.
The results calculated from only 'true' class are as follow

* f1 score:  98.1%
* precision score:  97.8%
* recall score:  98.5%

## Installation

Install using `pip` for stable release,

```bash
pip install deepcut
```

For latest development release,

```bash
pip install git+git://github.com/rkcosmos/deepcut.git
```

Or clone the repository and install using `setup.py`

```bash
python setup.py install
```

Make sure you are using `tensorflow` backend in `Keras` by making sure `~/.keras/keras.json` is as follows (see also https://keras.io/backend/)

```bash
{
  "floatx": "float32",
  "epsilon": 1e-07,
  "backend": "tensorflow",
  "image_data_format": "channels_last"
}
```

We do not add `tensorflow` in automatic installation process because it has cpu and gpu version. Installing cpu version to everyone might break those who already have gpu version installed. So please install tensorflow yourself following this guildline https://www.tensorflow.org/install/.

### Docker

Install Docker on your machine 

For Linux:
```bash
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sudo sh
docker build -t deepcut .
```

For other OS: see https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/

To run this Docker image:

```bash
docker run --rm -it deepcut
```

It will open a shell for us to play with deepcut.

## Usage

```python
import deepcut
deepcut.tokenize('ตัดคำได้ดีมาก')
```

Output will be in list format

```bash
['ตัด','คำ','ได้','ดี','มาก']
```

## Notes

Some texts might not be segmented as we would expected (e.g. 'โรงเรียน' -> ['โรง', 'เรียน']), this is because of

* BEST corpus (training data) tokenizes word this way (They use 'Compound words' as a criteria for segmentation)

* They are unseen/new words -> Ideally, this would be cured by having better corpus but it's not very practical so I am thinking of doing semi-supervised learning to incorporate new examples.

Any suggestion and comment are welcome, please post it in issue section.
