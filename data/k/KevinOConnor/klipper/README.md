Welcome to the Klipper project!

This project implements a 3d-printer firmware. There are two parts to
this firmware - code that runs on a micro-controller and code that
runs on a host machine. The host software does the work to build a
schedule of events, while the micro-controller software does the work
to execute the provided schedule at the specified times.

See the [features](docs/Features.md) document to find out why you
should use Klipper. To begin using Klipper start by
[installing](docs/Installation.md) it.

There is also [developer documentation](docs/Overview.md) available.
